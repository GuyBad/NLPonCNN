21c0bd69b7e7df285c3d1b1cf56d4da925980a68,"A middle-school teacher in China has inked hundreds of sketches that are beyond be-leaf. Politics teacher Wang Lian, 35,  has created 1000 stunning ink drawings covering subjects as varied as cartoon characters and landscapes to animals, birds according to the People's Daily Online. The intricate scribbles on leaves feature Wang's favourite sites across the city of Nanjing, which include the Presidential Palace, Yangtze River Bridge, the ancient Jiming Temple and the Qinhuai River. Natural canvas: Artist and teacher Wang Lian has done hundreds of drawings, like this temple, on leaves she collects in the park and on the streets . Delicate: She uses an ink pen to gently draw the local scenes and buildings on the dried out leaves . 'Although teaching politics is my job, drawing is my passion and hobby,' said Wang. 'I first tried drawing on leaves about 10 years ago and fell in love with it as an art form immediately. 'It's like drawing on very old parchment paper, you have to be really careful that you don't damage the leaf because it is very fragile and this helps focus your attention and abilities.' Wang started giving the drawings away on Christmas Eve in 2012 when her junior high school son came home saying he wanted to prepare some gifts for his classmates. Being an avid painter, Wang decided to give her son's friends unique presents of gingko leaf paintings. Wang loves gingko leaves and will often pick them up along Gingko Avenue, near to her school, in Nanjing in east China's Jiangsu province. Every autumn she collects about 2,000 leaves from the ground to ensure she has enough to cover spoils too. Intricate: Teacher Wang has drawn hundreds of local scenes on leaves she has collected from the park . Hobby: The artist collects leaves every autumn and dries them out so she can sketch these impressive building scenes . 'The colour and shape of gingko leaves are particularly beautiful,' she said. 'I need to collect around 2000 leaves because this will include losses'. She takes them home where she then presses them between the pages of books. 'Luckily, I have quite a lot of books and I try to use old ones or ones that I've already read so I don't end up with nothing to read.' Once they are dried, she carefully takes each one and using an ink fountain pen creates her masterpieces. She said: 'Some people are into capturing beauty through photography, but for me, a digitalised image just isn't the same. New leaf: Politics teacher Wang Lian has drawn hundreds of doodles on leaves for the last 10 years . 'By drawing what I see I become far more a part of the process and part of the final piece. 'One day I hope to be able to put my collection on display, but for now it's really just for my own pleasure.' Wang's leaf paintings are turned into bookmarks, postcards and sometimes even given as gifts to her her students so she can share the beauty of leaf paintings. But locals who have had the luck of being able to see Wang's art have been gobsmacked. Local art collector On Hao, 58, said: 'These are truly remarkable and beautiful creations. 'She has so much talent she is wasted in teaching.'","Works include pictures of Presidential Palace and Yangtze River Bridge .

56f340189cd128194b2e7cb8c26bb900e3a848b4,"A man convicted of killing the father and sister of his former girlfriend in a fiery attack on the family's Southern California home was sentenced to death on Tuesday. Iftekhar Murtaza, 30, was sentenced for the murders of Jay Dhanak, 56, and his daughter Karishma, 20, in May 2007, the Orange County district attorney's office said. Murtaza was convicted in December 2013 of killing the pair in an attempt to reunite with his then-18-year-old ex-girlfriend Shayona Dhanak. She had ended their relationship citing her Hindu family's opposition to her dating a Muslim. To be executed: Iftekhar Murtaza, 30, was sentenced to death Tuesday for the May 21, 2007 murders of his ex-girlfriend's father and sister and the attempted murder of her mother . Authorities said Murtaza and a friend torched the family's Anaheim Hills home and kidnapped and killed Dhanak's father and sister, leaving their stabbed bodies burning in a park 2 miles from Dhanak's dorm room at the University of California, Irvine. Dhanak's mother, Leela, survived the attack. She was stabbed and left unconscious on a neighbor's lawn. Murtaza was interviewed by police several days later and arrested at a Phoenix airport with a ticket to his native Bangladesh and more than $11,000 in cash. Jurors recommended that Murtaza be sentenced to death for the crimes. Attack: Murtaza torched his ex-girlfriend's family's Orange County home after they broke-up, believing the murders of her family would reunited them . Religious differences: Murtaza dated Shayona Dhanak when she was 18 in 2007. She broke up with him when her Hindu parents allegedly told her they would stop paying her college tuition if she continued to date the Muslim man . Two of his friends were also sentenced to life in prison for the murders, but one of them, Vitaliy Krasnoperov, recently had his conviction overturned on appeal. Authorities said Krasnoperov hatched the plot to kill the Dhanaks with Murtaza and tried to help him hire a hit man. They said another friend, Charles Murphy Jr., helped Murtaza carry out the killings after Dhanak said she planned to go on a date with someone else. During the trial, Murtaza testified that he told many people he wanted to kill the Dhanaks because he was distraught over the breakup, but he said he didn't mean it literally. Didn't do it alone: Two of Murtaza's friends have been convicted in connection to the killings . Killer: Leela Dhanak testified how Iftekhar Murtaza, seen in this August photo, murdered her husband and elder daughter in a failed attempt to win over her younger daughter . Bloodbath: Autopsy reports showed Jayprakash Dhanak (left) suffered 29 stab wounds to his body, while a pathologist testified that Karishma Dhanak (right) was alive when her throat was slit and her body set alight .","Iftekhar Murtaza, 29, was convicted a year ago of killing his ex-girlfriend's family in a fiery attack on the family home in 2007 .

In a breathtaking spectacle, England defeated France 55-35 in 'Le Crunch' - just six points short of the total required to lift the trophy. Sporting a navy blue suit, the fourth-in-line to the throne squirmed in his seat as England got off to a difficult start, despite an early try. Scroll down for video . Stress: The Prince can barely watch as England beat France 55-35 but narrowly missed out on the Six Nations . Taking its toll: Harry looks anxious as England struggled to cope with France's impressive start to the match . Passion: Prince Harry belts out the national anthem, seated behind England coach Stuart Lancaster . Despite their herculean effort, England could not find a final try and finished second in the championship, behind Ireland. After the match, England head coach Stuart Lancaster praised his side for 'one of the most courageous performances' he has seen from his side. 'It will go down as one of the great games of rugby,' he added. Earlier in the day, Ireland thrashed 40-10 in Edinburgh to mark a dismal campaign for the Scots and an impressive Wales ran riot in Rome, thumping Italy 61-20. All smiles: The fourth-in-line to the throne grins alongside students from Reigate School, in Surrey . Before England's crunch match against France, Prince Harry had met girls from Reigate School and The Quest Academy, Croydon, who had played in the warm-up game.

ce7460d21ce2336a0a8ee5812edd8b785b71811f,"The team with the lowest transfer outlay this season rose unassumingly into eighth place on Wednesday night. Stoke City beat Everton, to nobody’s great surprise, and look on course for their best Premier League finish yet – a year after their last. Mark Hughes really should be in the running for those annual accolades saluting success amid all this. Manager of the Year? Quite possibly. Mark Hughes looks on with a smile as his Stoke City side cruise to a 2-0 win over Everton on Wednesday . He has signed with remarkable shrewdness, shaped his players into a cohesive style, and overcome the set-backs of regular injuries to key players to guide Stoke to 42 points after 28 games. His team registered 50 Premier League points in reaching ninth last term, two club records, but are currently in a rich vein of form and likely to go higher. Seven wins from 11 in the league have seen Stoke nudge past West Ham United and Swansea – both clubs with claims to good seasons. And all the while forking out less cash on recruits than Burnley. That is the bit to amaze. Hughes has committed £1.2million on bringing in new players this season: £800,000 on brilliant Bojan from Barcelona, and £400,000 on young centre-back Dionatan Teixeira from Slovakian side Dukla Banska Bystrica. Mame Biram Diouf, scorer against Everton to take his tally to seven Premier League goals? Free from Hannover. Jon Walters (centre) congratulates Mame Biram Diouf after he scored Stoke's second goal on Wednesday . Phil Bardsley, a regular at right-back with 22 Premier League games? Free from Sunderland. Steve Sidwell, who has been adept when called upon, also cost nothing after leaving Fulham. Victor Moses, whose uncommonly good header broke the deadlock at the Britannia on Wednesday, is on loan from Chelsea. Philipp Wollscheid, who has come into defence at a vital period to instant effect, is on loan from Bayer Leverkusen with view to permanent move this summer. By contrast Burnley, hardly the most lavish of spenders, have parted with around £8m on transfer fees. Michael Kightly was one of Sean Dyche’s purchases, at £1.5m, from Stoke. Stoke also sold Cameron Jerome to Norwich and Ryan Shotton to Derby County for a combined cost of £2m – so in all are around £2.3m up on net transfer spend. No wonder Hughes is being rewarded with a new three-year contract that he is expected to sign in the coming days. His connections, influence, and words of persuasion played a big part in producing such positive market returns. The acquisition of Bojan, once the rising star of Barcelona, was smoothed by Hughes’s association with the Catalan giants. The player’s glistening form before he suffered a cruel knee injury, after initial struggles, a testament to Hughes’s motivational skills. Bojan Krkic hit a rich vein of form before his season has ended by a knee ligament injury . Clearly the support network from chairman Peter Coates, a Stoke fan since a boy and generous benefactor, and chief executive Tony Scholes enables Hughes to work to his full potential. The foundations laid by Tony Pulis in getting Stoke up from the Championship seven years ago and stabilising the club as a Premier League presence will never be forgotten. But Hughes has built on that, altering the side’s style to please the eye while retaining the strength of conviction which made Pulis’s reign so successful. The four forwards in his 4-2-3-1 system are interchangeable, with Moses, Diouf, Bojan, Jon Walters, Marko Arnautovic, Stephen Ireland, Charlie Adam, and Peter Crouch forming various combinations throughout the campaign. No shining lights as such, they offer a mixture of pace, nimble dexterity, and brawn. Again the cost is worth noting. Arnautovic was £2m from Werder Bremen, Ireland a free from Aston Villa. Hughes’s other signings since taking charge have been Erik Pieters, £3m from PSV Eindhoven, Marc Muniesa, free from Barcelona, and Peter Odemwingie, a swap with Cardiff with Kenwyne Jones heading the other way. Chelsea loanee Victor Moses (right) celebrates scoring Stoke's opener against Everton . Hughes has spent £6.2m in four transfer windows and improved. In this climate that is phenomenal. Equivalent to one 10th of Angel Di Maria, let’s say. Stoke are not averse to opening the wallet. A £10m package for Xherdan Shaqiri was put together in January before the Swiss forward elected for Inter. But when Stoke have suffered injuries it has not provoked a sudden splurge. Bojan has been out since late January after rupturing his cruciate ligament and is not back until September. Odemwingie has been out the entire campaign with the same injury. Captain Ryan Shawcross has missed the last six weeks with a back injury and is not fit yet. Moses missed two months with a thigh problem, Glenn Whelan was sidelined for five weeks. Now Ireland is out with that gashed leg. Hughes has rebuilt his managerial reputation after a disastrous spell at QPR . There have been other knocks but these are important players absent for extended periods. Hughes has addressed each situation as arisen and found a formula to cope. When Muniesa and Marc Wilson were injured at the same time as Shawcross last month it looked foolhardy to have sent Robert Huth out on loan to Leicester. But Stoke adjusted and came through. After his disastrous spell at Queens Park Rangers, it appeared Hughes’s stock had fallen below Premier League level. Coates had faith and is being rewarded. Up next is a trip to face West Bromwich Albion and Pulis on March 14. Last year’ s Premier League manager of the year and former Stoke boss versus his successor in both respects? Victory for Hughes would only strengthen that argument.","Stoke City beat Everton 2-0 to move up to eighth in the Premier League .

b5febe3ebb819b1743b6718288b2d93a41193c4f,"A team from a Spanish university . has discovered what Egyptian  authorities are calling the . world's oldest evidence of breast cancer in the 4,200-year-old . skeleton of an adult woman. Antiquities Minister Mamdouh el-Damaty said the bones of the . woman, who lived at the end of the 6th Pharaonic Dynasty, showed . 'an extraordinary deterioration'. 'The study of her remains shows the typical destructive . damage provoked by the extension of a breast cancer as a . metastasis,' he said in a statement on Tuesday. Antiquities Minister Mamdouh el-Damaty said the bones of the woman, who lived at the end of the 6th Pharaonic Dynasty, showed'an extraordinary deterioration'. According to the World Health Organisation's cancer research agency, new cancer cases rose to an estimated 14 million a year in 2012, a figure seen rising to 22 million within 20 years. Despite being one of the world's leading causes of death . today, cancer is virtually absent in archaeological records . compared to other diseases - which has given rise to the idea . that cancers are mainly attributable to modern lifestyles and to . people living for longer. 'The team from University of Jaen has confirmed that the woman lived at the end of the 6th Dynasty (2200 BCE) and was part of the élite of the southernmost town of Egypt, Elephantine,' the statement said. 'The virulence of the disease impeded her to carry out any kind of labor, but she was treated and taken care during a long period until her death. ' The University of Jaen began the archaeological excavations in Qubbet el-Hawa in 2008 and their major goal is to reconstruct the life and funerary rituals of the governors of Elephantine and their families who lived between 2250 and 1750 BCE. The anthropological team from the University of Jaen saidthe Egyptian woman was an aristocrat from Elephantine, the country's southernmost town. But the finding, along with evidence reported last year by . British researchers of metastatic cancer in a 3,000-year-old . skeleton found in a tomb in modern Sudan, suggests cancer was . around in the Nile Valley in ancient times. The anthropological team from the University of Jaen said . the Egyptian woman was an aristocrat from Elephantine, the . country's southernmost town. Her remains were discovered in the necropolis of Qubbet . el-Hawa, west of the southern city of Aswan, the ministry said. According to the World Health Organisation's cancer research . agency, new cancer cases rose to an estimated 14 million a year . in 2012, a figure seen rising to 22 million within 20 years. The anthropological team from the University of Jaen said the Egyptian woman was an aristocrat from Elephantine, the country's southernmost town (pictured) Other analysis - including examination of the last food found in the stomachs of three horses buried in her tomb - allowed Dr Polesmak to formulate an intriguing account of this woman's final months alive . Last year a unique MRI scan on a 2,500 year old mummified Siberian 'princess' has revealed she died after suffering from acute breast cancer. Preserved in ice in an elaborate grave in the Altai Mountains, the ancient woman - famous for her remarkable tattoos - took cannabis to dull the ravages of her illnesses, experts have also discovered. Dug from her permafrost burial chamber on the high Ukok Plateau in 1993, analysis of her remains earlier highlighted sophisticated tattoos of 'great artistry' of fantastical creatures, while in her tomb was also found clothing and headdresses, a make-up bag, and a stash of cannabis, enabling experts to build a detailed picture of her life and looks. Separately from the MRI, academics also conclude she was a virgin who lived a deliberately 'celibate' life.","Woman was an aristocrat from Elephantine, country's most southern town .

4a039636bd3f339eceb4f46312d1b2daa4fa3cf0,"A doctor who made a stand against sexism in medicine has received hundreds of messages of support from disgruntled women physicians across the world. Dr Ashleigh Witt, who works as a medical registrar, posted a lengthy post on her blog discussing how she is frequently belittled because of her sex, with people regularly referring to her as a 'lady doctor' instead of just 'doctor'. She pointed out that she has also been judged by members of the profession in the higher ranks of her hospital who claimed she got into her position because she was pretty. Dr Ashleigh Witt, who works as a medical registrar in Melbourne . Writing on blogspot.com, Dr Witt, from Melbourne, Australia, said: 'Sexual harassment is every time you call me ""blondie"" or ""Barbie"", every time you make a joke about my choice to wear a skirt not pants, every time you comment on my appearance rather than my skillset, every time you call me a ""lady doctor"" instead of a ""doctor"". 'Sexual harassment is two weeks ago when I lead a code blue which saved a woman on the labour ward and my male colleague arrived after the fact and said, ""they shouldn’t send you up here, you’re too clucky"". She continued: 'It’s also the consultant who commented that I’d ""obviously gotten to where I was at a young age because I was pretty"" (Um, maybe I’m actually good at my job?). 'It’s the surgical registrar who told me if I wanted to be taken seriously I needed to dye my hair dark.' Dr Witt wrote the essay in response to recent comments by a respected Australian vascular surgeon called Dr Gabrielle McMullin, who suggested women should accept sexual advances by their male colleagues instead of making a complaint that could damage their career. Dr Witt, who says she has faced sexual harassment at work . Dr Witt believes that sexual comments of the kind she has experienced are causing serious damage to the medical profession. She said: 'These seemingly harmless comments, coupled with the line that we 'need to take a joke', teach women in medicine that they need to just accept everyday sexual harassment. 'And worse still, they encourage those deeds further along the spectrum of sexual harassment. 'Where do we draw the line between commenting on someone's appearance to commenting on her body to making an unwanted sexual advance? 'Clearly we're having a great deal of trouble with the grey zone, so why don't we stop subtle sexual harassment where it starts.' Dr Witt ended her blog post with a call to arms for female medical workers, suggesting that they point out sexual harassment when it happened to the person in question. She said: 'I’m going to ask you,that this week you look out for subtle sexual harassment and call it out. 'Whether you’re the med student, the consultant, the nurse, the dietician or the plaster tech, that when you hear a comment towards a woman that would not be made if she was a man say ""hey! Let’s not make jokes based on gender"", or ""I don't think that's appropriate."" 'Maybe, just maybe, the tiny ripples of change could start here.' The blog, which was posted on Sunday, has since been praised by thousands around the world. ‏@cathimon wrote on Twitter: Excellent piece.

Referee Craig Thompson sent-off Van Dijk before making a major gaffe when he wrongly dismissed Butcher's Terrors team-mate Paul Paton.

Hoops boss Ronny Deila celebrates winning his first piece of silverware since arriving at Parkhead . That left both men sweating on their places for Sunday's QTS Scottish League Cup showdown at Hampden. But there was relief for Van Dijk and Paton as they were later cleared to play after successful appeals to the Scottish Football Association's disciplinary panel. And it was the Celtic centre-half who was left bearing the brightest grin as his side clinched Ronny Deila's first trophy as Parkhead boss with a 2-0 win at the National Stadium. Van Dijk said: 'It was quite a tough week. I've never experienced anything like it in my life. 'It would have been very disappointing if I'd not been allowed to play on Sunday, especially with it being my first final ever. 'But you know, justice was served and I was able to play. Luckily I got the red card overturned and we did a good job.' The Dutch defender was sent off for a clash with Callum Butcher in Scottish Cup quarter finals . Van Dijk is sent off but was later cleared to play on Sunday following a successful appeal . Dundee United's Paul Paton also had his red card rescinded after being wrongly sent off . Van Dijk has been linked with summer moves to south, with Barclays Premier League high-flyers Arsenal and Southampton monitoring his progress. But for now the 23-year-old is happy to enjoy Celtic's treble chase. 'It means a lot to have lifted the League Cup,' he said. 'It's my first cup trophy ever. 'This club is an amazing place, I have always said that. I have been improving since the day came here. 'That is the most important thing for a player. If you win trophies, that's even better.' Kris Commons fired Celtic ahead midway through the first half before substitute James Forrest stroked home a second 12 minutes from time. The Hoops winger also had time to miss a late penalty as a United side that spent the last 35 minutes a man down following skipper Sean Dillon's red card avoided a heavier defeat. However, Jackie McNamara's team will go for revenge when the sides meet for part three of their four-game duel with Wednesday's Scottish Cup replay. Van Dijk said: 'We made it tough for ourselves on Sunday and should have finished the game faster in the second half. James Forrest celebrates scoring Celtic's second goal before missing a late penalty at Hampden . Scorer of Celtic's first goal, Kris Commons, celebrates with the trophy following Celtic's win . 'One-nil is a dangerous score - if they had scored one goal they would have had the believe to hit us with everything. 'At moments it looked tough but Craig Gordon only had one save to make in the first half and nothing in the second half, so I think we did well. 'It's a big boost for us ahead of Wednesday night. We can go for the second cup now full of confidence. 'They will be up for it on Wednesday night and know they have possibilities with the players coming back in to their team. 'But we need to be ready and win the game.'","Celtic defeated Dundee United 2-0 in Scottish League Cup final on Sunday .

b548af6fff8daaf4f68c71e6c94ab90f1f5d24ff,"An American woman who went on the run for six years rather than face jail over a fatal DUI has been linked to a second death - after allegedly treating a backpacker with an 'African potion' at a backstreet Thai clinic. Kelly Lynn Miller, 36 - a former Alabama stripper and prostitute - was handed a five-year sentence for mowing down truck driver Donald Goodwin, 56, in 2004. Miller was released on $50,000 appeal bond in 2009 but fled to Thailand, where she changed her name to Bea, switched from blonde to brunette and threw away her U.S. passport. Brazen: Kelly Lynn Miller, a 36-year-old fugitive, was pictured topping up her lip gloss at a press conference after being hauled in front of the media following her six-year flight from justice in Thailand . Victim: Brodie Smith went to Thailand with his girlfreind Kara Spark to attempt to kick drugs. He died after taking ibogaine at a 'clinic' run by Victor Cracknell and Mike Picone, his mother and girlfriend said. The fugitive, who gave birth to a baby boy while on the run, was finally captured this week and faces being deported to the U.S. to serve her original five-year jail term. However Daily Mail Online can reveal she is also linked to another fatality involving a man who died after undergoing an experimental drug treatment at an unregistered Thai clinic. Australian Brodie Smith, 33, checked into the Ibogaine Thailand retreat on Koh Phangan island to try to kick his methamphetamine addiction. Miller – a former nanny with no formal medical training - is said to have worked there as an assistant to two American expats. Victim: Miller killed Donald Goodwin, left, when she drunkenly smashed into his tractor-trailer in Alabama in 2004. Miller is pictured right in a mugshot from the time, when she was 26 . Former life: Pictured is the gentlemen's club in Birmingham, Alabama, where Miller allegedly worked before fleeing to Thailand . All three have been accused of administering Smith with ibogaine, a dangerous herbal hallucinogen derived from an African tree. The substance is used in tribal rituals in Gabon and neighboring states where many believe it can be successfully used to cure drug addiction. However, the World Health Assembly warns that its psychoactive properties are highly dangerous, and users say it sends them into a dream-like psychedelic state. Mr Smith's girlfriend Kara Spark, 26, says he stopped breathing shortly after taking his second dose along with another drug - thought to be Valium - during the $5,000 treatment last October. The clinic has denied giving Mr Smith ibogaine, saying the backpacker from Mandurah, Western Australia, injected himself with an overdose of ‘illegal narcotics’. Thailand's Ministry of Health took no action over the death - but Mr Smith's mother Diane Tucker has called on the Australian government to push for a proper inquiry. She has also identified Miller as Bea - the glamorous female assistant to the retreat's principal operators, Mike Picone and Victor Cracknell, both from Buffalo, New York. Mr Cracknell is believed to be the father of Miller’s baby boy, who was born two months ago on the island of Samui. He told Thai authorities he had no idea she was a fugitive, according to the Phuketwan newspaper. Miller was finally snared on the remote island of Koh Lanta, off the coast of Thailand’s Krabi province, following a tip from the U.S. Embassy. Drug clinic boss: Victor Cracknell was one of the two business partners running the Ibogaine 'clinic' where Brodie Smith died. Smith's mother says Kelly Lynn Miller was the woman at the clinic who called herself 'Bea' Paradise lost: Miller was on the remote island of Koh Lanta when she was arrested by tourist police in Thailand on Tuesday. Above, a view of the island . Difference: This home in Helena, Alabama, is where Miller lived when the fatal 2004 crash took place . Thai media reported that at around 9am Tuesday local time, an officer with the Tourist Police approached her in the parking lot of a Koh Lanta guesthouse and asked to see her passport. When she was unable to produce the document, the officer arrested her. The pretty fugitive was paraded in front of the press but appeared unconcerned by the media attention, casually reapplying lip-gloss as the cameras rolled. Thai authorities suspect Miller's relatives in the US had been wiring money to help her make ends meet. But Miller's mother Penney, 70, told Daily Mail Online she ‘laughed’ when she read about the accusations, adding: 'There's no money here to send her.' Unmoved: Miller looked nonchalant, and rested her head in her hands as she stood flanked by police officers at a news conference in Phuket, Thailand . 'All my dreams now become impossible': Kara Spark, from Mandurah Western Australia, was with her boyfriend Brodie Smith when he tried to 'cure' his drug addiction with ibogaine in Thailand, she said. She went on: 'I only knew she was in Thailand because the U.S. Marshals told me. Other than that all I know is what I hear on the TV. 'She called me a few months back to say ""Mom, I’m pregnant,"" that was the first time I'd heard from her since she left. 'Had I had a chance to speak to her sooner, of course I would have told her to come back and turn herself in. 'At least I know she's finally coming home.’ Another island: Ko Phangan island was where the unregistered clinic operated by Cracknell and Picone, both from Buffalo, NY, was operating when Brodie Smith died. A third woman there, Bea, has been identified by the dead man's mother as Miller, who was on the run from Alabama . Miller struck and killed Donald Goodwin while driving drunk on Interstate 459 near her home in Hoover, just south of Birmingham, in September 2004. The Florida truck driver had pulled over in the emergency lane and was checking his tires when Miller hit his vehicle and careened into him. Miller was due to go on trial in January 2007 on a charge of vehicular homicide but pleaded guilty. Mission: Dianne Tucker, the dead man's mother, is campaigning for a murder probe into her son's death. She identified Miller as 'Bea', the woman at the 'clinic' when he died . She was set to report to prison but fled Alabama after making a $50,000 appeal bond and was officially declared a fugitive in 2010. Probation papers describe her as a former nanny who left her $10-an-hour job to become a ‘self-employed entertainer’ making $4,000 a month. But Daily Mail Online can reveal that the busty divorcee led a seedy double-life as an exotic dancer and prostitute. A law enforcement source said: 'Kelly Miller is a very pretty girl from a good, upper-middle class family. ‘She's not stupid. She's entrepreneurial; she’s a survivor. She is a very good business person with an ability to manipulate men. ‘This business in Thailand fits exactly with the sort of person she is. She was never going to go over there to become a barrister or a newspaper reporter. ‘There’s no doubt she was working here as a prostitute. She probably carried on doing what she was good at in Thailand.’ Miller separated from her ex-husband Brett Street before her fatal DUI crash. Mr Street committed suicide in 2007 but his father Chris, 67, insisted his death had nothing to do with Miller and described her as a ‘pretty, sweet girl’. Former neighbors in the quiet Hoover street where she lived before vanishing overnight remember her less fondly. They told Daily Mail Online they suspected she used her three-bedroom, $350,000 home as a set for porn films. Business: Mike Picone, of Buffalo, NY, was the other business partner in the Ibogaine Thailand Clinic where Brodie Smith went for treatment before he died. Boast: What Cracknell posted on Facebook about what happened at the clinic . One said: 'This isn't the sort of neighborhood where you expect to see a Mercedes Benz or a limo but they would be parked outside her house all weekend. 'I don't know for sure if they were doing porn but people would turn up in all sorts of costumes. 'We would see all women coming and going in cheerleader outfits. The girls were all cute and there were a lot of blondes. 'The men would wear leather trousers and there was even one we saw wearing military fatigues - it was all very entertaining. According to her housemate she was obsessed with facial surgeries. 'She had certainly had her breasts done. They were very big - we called her Jugs.' Quasi-scientific: Victor Cracknell posted these pictures on Facebook of his 'clinic'. It did not have a permanent location but operated from hotel rooms. The mother of an Australasian who died after attending the clinic says Kelly Lynn Miller was involved with it and Cracknell was the father of her baby . Bill Veitch, the chief deputy district attorney who originally prosecuted Miller said she would likely have only served half of her five-year jail sentence for killing Mr Goodwin had she gone straight to prison. With good behaviour he predicts Miller will now serve the full five years - thought probably not any more. ‘If she had stayed here she would have likely been out in less than three years,' he told Daily Mail Online. ‘Now she's got a two-month-old child, honestly I think her capture is a blessing for that child that can now grow up here and a normal life. ‘It really hurt Donald Goodwin’s family when she ran. They are just profoundly grateful to the U.S. Marshals for tracking her down.’ Root: Ibogaine is made from this root, of a plant found on the banks of a river in Nigeria. It is illegal in the United States and Australia and regarded as a severe health risk for its hallucinogenic effects .","Kelly Lynn Miller, 36, was arrested on a remote island in Thailand this week after vanishing from Alabama, where she was supposed to be in jail .

57f88e1055acb2b857a378a7c64de2bfd4563658,"(CNN)After months racing not only to treat Ebola but to find ways to prevent it, health authorities will launch a vaccination campaign Saturday in one of the areas that has been most devastated by the disease. The trial, using vaccines developed by the Public Health Agency of Canada, will be administered in Basse Guinee, a region that has had the highest number of Ebola cases in Guinea. Another vaccine will be tested in a subsequent study, according to a press release from the World Health Organization, Medecins Sans Frontieres (Doctors Without Borders), and the Norwegian Institute of Public Health. ""We have worked hard to reach this point,"" WHO Director-General Dr. Margaret Chan said. ""... If a vaccine is found effective, it will be the first preventive tool against Ebola in history."" Patient Zero -- i.e. the first case in the current Ebola outbreak -- is thought to be a 2-year-old Guinean boy who contracted the virus in December 2013 and died a few days later. Since then, the vast majority of the more than 23,900 cases and more than 9,800 deaths reported by WHO have come in Guinea and neighboring Liberia and Sierra Leone. There are new Ebola cases every day, including 132 in the last week of February (which is up from 99 reported the previous week). While Liberia didn't have any of these new incidences, Guinea did -- especially in Forecariah and Conakry. Still, authorities in Africa and their partners around the world have had significant successes generally in combating the deadly disease. The progress -- as measured in the rate of new cases, with January's incidences being the lowest in seven months -- has been so significant that health authorities' focus has shifted from slowing the spread to ending the epidemic. This positive movement has come as a result of steps like better disease control, public awareness campaigns and attention to burial practices. But the tool that has been used to eradicate many other contagious diseases -- vaccines -- has been elusive. That's why, over the past six months, WHO has been working with scientists, ethicists and policymakers to try to create both better treatment therapies and a vaccine that will stop people for getting Ebola in the first place. Health workers in the Guinea trial will start with a new Ebola case and then trace all of that patient's contacts, giving each of them the option of getting vaccinated. John-Arne Rottingen, from the Norwegian Institute of Public Health, said this program is happening at the request of Guinean authorities and called the participation of residents there ""vital"" to its success. ""The Ebola epidemic shows signs of receding but we cannot let our guard down until we reach zero cases,"" WHO official Marie-Paule Kieny said. ""An effective vaccine to control current flare-ups could be the game-changer to finally end this epidemic and an insurance policy for any future ones.""","WHO leader: This vaccine could be ""the first preventive tool against Ebola in history""
This trial campaign will be conducted in a hard-hit region of the West African nation of Guinea .
Authorities have had success in curbing Ebola, but dozens of new cases still arise each week ."

Silvano Espindola revealed that Falcao phoned him from Old Trafford last week before he was made to play for the Under 21s against Tottenham and admitted he felt ‘weird’ about the situation. The 29-year-old striker also expressed fears that he risked a recurrence of his serious knee injury by playing against lower-grade opposition.

Falcao lined up for United's development side against Tottenham, but failed to make an impact on the game . Falcao is earning £280,000-a-week during his loan to United from Monaco, but it looks increasingly unlikely that Louis van Gaal will sanction a £43million deal to make the move permanent at the end of the season. The former Porto and Atletico Madrid man has only scored four goals for United and has not started a game for three weeks.

We talked for about 20 minutes while he arrived at the stadium and he told me “something like this had never happened to me – I don’t know how to handle the situation, I feel weird!” ‘He was a little fearful because he is afraid of those matches with the youth teams and of the second and third divisions.

9e92dcf4f0b4792ecebf7f6990a7d2b794eb2cb9,"Officers have arrested 21-year-old Matthew Ellery (pictured) on suspicion of theft . A UKIP candidate handed his own son – a Ukip councillor – in to police after discovering valuable stock from his antiques shop had been stolen. Alan Stone, 50, said the decision to take Matthew Ellery to the police had been the most difficult of his life. But he added that he hoped it would show he was capable of making hard choices and worthy of a seat at Westminster. Mr Stone is hoping to oust the disgraced former culture secretary Maria Miller in May. The father-of-four admitted he had a 'lump in his throat' as he apparently escorted the 21-year-old to the local police station. Officers arrested Ellery on suspicion of theft. Mr Stone said: 'It was the hardest thing I have ever had to do but I would do it again. I took him to the police station, absolutely. I did what I had to do. The police are still investigating.' The grandfather added: 'I made a complaint about stock going missing – whether he stole it from me I do not know yet. I will stand by him when it is all over. He is my son.' Ellery, who controversially won a place on Basingstoke and Dean Council last year, has been released on bail until after the election. Mr Stone, who was announced as Ukip's candidate for Basingstoke last year, said he was hopeful of winning the seat despite the arrest. 'It is a family issue,' he said. 'It could be very positive. The fact that I am willing to take my own children to court if they do something wrong is a positive move. I am capable of taking the hard decisions if they are needed.' Alan Stone, 50, said the decision to take his son to the police had been the most difficult of his life . The parliamentary candidate admitted his action had received 'mixed reactions' from the rest of his family, with some even suggesting the move was politically motivated. He added that he had not seen his son, who uses his mother's maiden name, for a week. Ellery's election to his local council was shrouded in controversy, coming as it did after he caused outrage by branding the women in his town 'pug ugly' on social media. He also posted a message on Facebook saying that he 'felt like stabbing someone'. Mr Stone went to the police three weeks ago after finding stock had been stolen from his shop Squirrel Antiques in Basingstoke over the last year. The businessman, who also runs Stone's Fine Jewellery in the Hampshire town, would not confirm the value of the theft but it is believed the items taken amount to tens of thousands of pounds. Mr Stone said: 'The police do not know the exact figure. I know my stock has gone missing over the past year – of course I do.' Hampshire police said: 'The 21-year-old arrested man has been re-bailed pending further enquiries. He's now due to return on bail on May 14.' Basingstoke and Dean Council said it had not been informed of the arrest and Ellery had not been suspended. Ukip refused to comment saying it was a family matter. Sorry we are not currently accepting comments on this article.","Ukip candidate Alan Stone, 50, handed son, Matthew Ellery, over to police .

faba1b198798edd16efa476899c836afbf88488d,"A self-driving car is gearing up for  a 3,500-mile cross-country road trip from San Francisco to New York that begins next week. A person will always be behind the wheel of the autonomous car, developed by Delphi Automotive, in order to take control if there is a situation the vehicle cannot handle on its own. The car will begin its journey on March 22 so that it can reach New York in time for the International Auto Show. Scroll down for video . A self-driving car developed by Delphi Automotive is preparing for a 3,500-mile cross-country road trip next week that will take it from San Francisco to New York . Delphi, a major Michigan-based auto supplier, is planning for the car to drive eight hours a day for eight days. The autonomous vehicle will mainly stick to the highways, where it will be able to pass slower cars and maintain a safe distance from other automobiles all on its own. Delphi CTO Jeff Owens told WIRED the road trip will be the 'ultimate test' for the vehicle, as it will be exposed to a 'range of driving conditions' as well as various types of weather. It's design is based on a 2014 Audi SQ5. According to Delphi officials, the road trip will be the longest automated drive ever attempted in North America. In 2010 an autonomous van created by Italian company VisLab completed an 8,000-mile journey from Europe to Shanghai for three months. Unlike Google's driverless car (pictured), Dephi's vehicle senors are tucked in the car's front, rear and sides and thus cannot be seen. Although it will be the Delphi car's longest journey, it won't be its first. The Delphi vehicle has driven around the company's Silicon Valley office and has already completed a trip from San Francisco to Los Angeles. But the car really earned its stripes when, during a demonstration at the Las Vegas Consumer Electronics Show in January, it braked by itself as two drunk men stumbled into the street in front of it. Delphi says the vehicle is capable of making complex decisions, like stopping and then proceeding at a four-way stop, merging onto the highway or maneuvering around a bicyclist or a trash can. When the car wants the driver to resume control, it uses a verbal warning and flashes lights on the dashboard. Although most experts say a true driverless vehicle is at least a decade away, Delphi's autonomous automobile is helping the technology look more like a regular car. Unlike other driverless cars developed by Google and Honda, the lidar sensors on Dephi's vehicle are tucked in the car's front, rear and sides and thus cannot be seen. The car also has cameras throughout, including one that watches the driver. Because lidar systems can cost around $70,000 apiece, they drive up the price of the autonomous prototypes. But Delphi engineer Doug Welk said one of the reasons for the road trip is to help decide what combination of sensors is best suited for the car, which will ultimately help lower costs. Delphi estimates it will cost around $5,000 to make a vehicle almost fully autonomous by 2019. Delphi CTO Jeff Owens said the road trip would be the 'ultimate test' for the autonomous vehicle, as it would be exposed to a 'range of driving conditions' as well as various types of weather .","The Delphi Automotive car will drive eight hours a day for eight days .

The company asked for them to be taken down almost immediately after the incident, which killed 150 people. Adverts for Germanwings with the slogan 'get ready to be surprised' are being removed from the London tube network following Tuesday's crash . The adverts, which have a picture of an air hostess as well as images of popular German destinations, said: 'Get ready to be surprised. Visit Germany. 'Enjoy the variety of Germany and fly to e.g. Berlin or Hamburg.' A Transport for London spokesman confirmed they were taking the posters down as quickly as possible. They said: 'Our advertising department was contacted by the company and asked to remove the adverts on Tuesday. 'We had 65 digital adverts that were taken down within an hour.

Well it seems Today show host Karl Stefanovic does, as he appeared on the breakfast show this morning bearing his pins in a pair of tiny black shorts. The 40-year-old gold Logie winner, who was taking part in a segment on how to be a good morning person, is known for being one of Australia's biggest jokers and he certainly got into the spirit of the exercise routines, displaying his sporty physique in a range of questionable poses. Scroll down for video . Karl Stefanovic donned a pair of tiny shorts on Thursday's Today show . The loveable rogue, who was joined on set by co-host Lisa Wilkinson and fitness instructor Michael Ryan, turned all of Australia into morning people this morning, keeping them entertained as he twisted and stretched in his hotpants. Lisa Wilkinson could barely contain herself as she laughed through the opening half of the segment, claiming she didn't know why all the floor staff were in stitches. As the fitness trainer demonstrated the best exercises for a healthy morning routine, Karl, who was wearing a pair of Birkenstocks with socks, stretched out his legs. apparently not too concerned about his tiny shorts showing off too much skin. The 40-year-old took part in a segment abut early fitness routines . The joker got some strange looks from co-host Laura Wilkinson and trainer Michael Ryan regarding his Birkenstocks, which he teamed with a pair of black socks . During a segment of sit-ups, Karl extended his leg outward, taking pleasure in watching Lisa and Michael squirm as Olivia Newton-John's Physical played in the background. Casually acting like this was his usual attire, Karl seemed comfortable in his fashion choice, although the same could not be said for Michael Ryan, who seemed disturbed at Karl's attire. 'That's not pretty, I think we should stand up guys because it's not good TV at this point in time,' the fitness guru said. 'He's like a dog about to walk up on a tree.' Karl did little to protect his modesty during the exercise segment . The trainer looked on in confusion as Karl spread his legs in his tiny hotpants . However the joker was unfazed by the trainer's comments and continued with his showy display. 'What? If you don't like it look away,' he jokingly said. That's when things took an unsightly turn, as the trainer introduced the lateral lunge. There was no escaping this move for Karl and he conceded to defeat as he put his hands down to cover his modesty. Twitter users loved Karl's exercise routine, with one commenter claiming she his workout made her want to workout all day long. Another user commented on Karl's disposition during the whole segment, claiming he demonstrated the Australian version of blue steel. However the joker was unfazed by the trainer's comments and continued with his showy display . In November, the Today show co-host shocked viewers when he revealed that he had been wearing the exact same cheap Burberry suit on air for a year, to prove a point about the double standards women face, especially in the television industry. Stefanovic said he had not received one complaint about his repetitive attire over the year, but his female co-host Lisa Wilkinson regularly copped criticism about the way she looked. 'No one has noticed; no one gives a s**t,' he told Fairfax Media. 'Women, they wear the wrong colour and they get pulled up. They say the wrong thing and there's thousands of tweets written about them. 'I'm judged on my interviews, my appalling sense of humour – on how I do my job, basically. Whereas women are quite often judged on what they're wearing or how their hair is ... that's (what I wanted to test).' During a segment of sit-ups, Karl extended his leg outward, taking pleasure in watching Lisa and Michael squirm as Olivia Newton-John's Physical played in the background . Casually acting like this was his usual attire, Karl seemed comfortable in his fashion choice, although the same could not be said for Michael Ryan, who seemed disturbed at Karl's attire . Stefanovic's experiment  sparked worldwide media interest from websites like the BBC and New York Post. Karl, whose funny streak has seen him become one of the biggest names on television, admitted on Wednesday that he once got into some trouble on the Gold Coast. Speaking on KIIS FM's Kyle and Jackie O Show with hosts Kyle Sandilands and Jackie 'O' Henderson, he was asked if he'd ever been in trouble with the law. 'Yeah I got locked up on the Gold Coast once,' he replied, with a shocked Jackie quickly asking what he'd done to land himself in jail. 'I was at Billy’s nightclub…and I went out to the foyer, and there was a big life size poster of [Australian sportsman and former ironman] Trevor Hendy – and I thought it would be a good idea to take that off the wall and run outside with it.' Karl explained where it all went wrong and said: 'Well I was so drunk I ran all the way around the block to the waiting police!.'","Today show host Karl Stefanovic donned a pair of tiny shorts on TV .

f354360360ab62603c850af203a0484e883fa1fd,"Bosses at trendy clothing firm American Apparel have been rapped for a 'too sexy' advert showing a female model wearing a 'thong bodysuit'. The firm, which has more than 270 stores across the world, regularly has its raunchy ads banned by the Advertising Standards Authority (ASA). In 2012 the firm had a string of ads banned in four different rulings after using photos of women exposing their breasts, showing off their bare bums and posing with their legs spread in its ad campaigns. This American Apparel advert featuring an underage-looking model has been banned by the Advertising Standards Authority . And this week, the ASA again banned an advert showing a flame-haired model wearing a £30 spandex thong bodysuit covered with lipstick prints. One person had complained to the ASA saying they believed the model in question looked under the age of 16 and that it was 'irresponsible and offensive' as it 'sexualised a model' who appeared to be underage. Bosses at the ASA said that despite American Apparel saying the model was 20 years old, she looked 'youthful' and that the ad was irresponsible. It stated: 'We considered the model had a youthful appearance and that some consumers were likely to regard her as being younger than 16 years of age. 'The model was shown looking back at the camera over her shoulder with her buttocks visible. The campaign featured more than one picture of the girl in the bodysuit to '[depict] the thong from various angles' 'We considered that readers were likely to interpret the model's expression and pose as being sexual in nature. 'In conjunction with the youthful appearance of the model, we considered the ad could be seen to sexualise a child. 'We therefore concluded that the ad was irresponsible and was likely to cause serious offence.' It added: 'The ad must not appear again in its current form. 'We told American Apparel (UK) Ltd to ensure future ads did not include images that inappropriately sexualised young women or were likely to cause serious offence.' Bosses at the clothing firm said the the model was 20 and that the ad 'depicted the thong from various angles'. This isn't  the first time that American Apparel has been in trouble for their adverts. Last September, a  campaign for the fashion brand American Apparel has been banned for ‘sexualising school-age girls’. Photographs of its ‘School Days’ range included a young woman bending over in an ultra- short tartan skirt with her white underwear on display. In a scathing attack, the advertising watchdog labelled the campaign ‘gratuitous’ and ‘sexist’. The Advertising Standards Authority (ASA) said ‘the focus was on her buttocks and groin rather than on the skirt being modelled’. It also accused the firm of promoting seedy ‘up-skirt’ photographs – when unauthorised pictures are taken from beneath a woman’s skirt. The brand launched its Back-to-School range with the slogan, ‘Your first assignment is to dress accordingly.’ Last year, the fashion company got in trouble for this picture of a 'schoolgirl' leaning over a car door . The campaign included pictures of a model bent over touching the ground, revealing her crotch and underwear, while another showed a woman bending over a red car in a thigh-skimming green tartan skirt and her buttocks on show. The ASA said: ‘We considered the images were gratuitous and objectified women, and were therefore sexist and likely to cause serious and widespread offence. Last January,the brand stirred up controversy for decking out its mannequins with very visible patches of untamed pubic hair. A storefront at the retailer's East Houston location in New York featured three mannequins clad in transparent white underwear, exposing their unkempt bikini lines.","American Apparel has been told off by the Advertising Standards Authority .

3b4e3959752fb438ed85b7bfd6171485225e5a33,"Coroner Mary Hassell, who claims she has been left in fear of violence after being falsely accused of anti-Semitism . A senior coroner has accused Orthodox Jews of bullying and intimidating her in an extraordinary row over the handling of dead bodies. Mary Hassell claims she and her staff have been left in fear of violence after being bombarded by hundreds of complaints about how they deal with deaths in devoutly religious communities. In a letter seen by The Mail on Sunday, she says she has been falsely accused of anti-Semitism and warns the situation risks becoming ‘volatile’. She says that on one occasion the police had to be called when 60 Orthodox Jews refused to let undertakers take the body of a man whose body they wanted to pray over. Mrs Hassell believes other families in the North London area she covers are ‘suffering’ because she has to spend so much of her time dealing with the large number of Orthodox Jews, whose faith requires them to bury their dead quickly and prevents them undergoing autopsies. But the Orthodox Jews say they are being ‘traumatised’ by the coroner’s disregard for their beliefs, forcing them to take unprecedented legal action against her. Both sides will soon face each other in the High Court in a case that could lead to all families being given the right to demand a high-tech scan to determine cause of death rather than the traditional surgical post- mortem examination. In a letter to her bosses at Camden Council, Mrs Hassell writes: ‘I look forward to hearing how you intend to support those who work within the service for which you have statutory responsibility, and protect them from bullying, intimidation and the threat of violence.’ But Rabbi Asher Gratt told this newspaper: ‘The Jewish community is increasingly traumatised by Mrs Hassell’s conduct. It’s getting to the point where elderly people are scared to die in England – literally. A pair of Orthodox Jews wait for a bus in London. In their faith, they believe they need to bury their loved ones within a day of their death so the period of mourning can begin . ‘I’m actually aware of at least one elderly couple who have happily lived in the UK since the Second World War but who have now emigrated permanently due to their fear of being subjected to unnecessary delays of their funerals when they pass away – or, worse still, a post-mortem autopsy.’ The row has arisen because Jews believe they need to bury their loved ones within a day of their death so the period of mourning can begin. They also believe that traditional post-mortem examinations amount to desecration of the body. But when a doctor is unable to state a cause of death and sign the medical certificate needed before a body can be released for burial, a coroner must decide if a post-mortem examination is required. This process can take several days. Following years of campaigning by Muslims and Jews – who share many beliefs on burial customs – the Ministry of Justice has agreed that all coroners in London will operate an out-of-hours service from next month. Others in England and Wales already do so.","Coroner Mary Hassell claims she and her staff are in fear of violence .

889d52651ff7b8615b5c681dbf1116c1b88fc6c9,"The biggest impression Grant Elliott had made on world cricket came when he was barged by Ryan Sidebottom during a one-day international at the Oval seven years ago and was unwittingly caught in the middle of a major row between England and New Zealand. Now he will be remembered for all the right reasons. Elliott, a little known all-rounder born in South Africa but a naturalised Kiwi, played one of the great one-day innings on Tuesday for his adopted country against the nation of his birth to take New Zealand to their first World Cup final. It led to jubilant scenes at Auckland’s Eden Park, a venue more readily associated with New Zealand’s rugby triumphs than cricketing ones, and breathed life into a tournament in which exciting finishes have been all too rare. Grant Elliott celebrates hitting a six against South Africa to put New Zealand through to the World Cup final . Daniel Vettori embraces Elliott while bowler Dale Steyn lays on the ground after the crucial blow . Elliott, 36, powered his way to what would be a match-winning unbeaten 84 in the Black Caps chase . What a day for New Zealand and what a day for 36-year-old Elliott, who had not played international cricket for 14 months when he became one of coach Mike Hesson’s inspired choices for this World Cup. Elliott beams as he meets the press after the match . Elliott will surely never play another innings like his unbeaten 84 which earned New Zealand the most nerve-racking of victories with just a ball to spare against a South African team who fell short when it most mattered yet again. And Elliott will surely never play another shot like the six that soared over the short long-on boundary with five needed off two balls from the world’s greatest fast bowler in Dale Steyn. A man who has had a largely anonymous career that has taken in Transvaal, Wellington and Surrey was humble enough to console the stricken Steyn in scenes reminiscent of Andrew Flintoff’s Ashes embrace of Brett Lee in 2005. Then Elliott talked of how much this means for a country who will now take on either Australia or India in the final on Sunday after falling short in no fewer than six previous World Cup semi-finals. ‘I was looking to hit that ball for six or four,’ said Elliott. ‘I was just going to line it up and it was going over the boundary. It means a lot to the players but you only had to look to the stands to see how much it meant to a lot of people.’ This was glorious vindication for the attacking, modern brand of one-day cricket that New Zealand have been producing under their impressive captain Brendon McCullum with players who have not always been regarded as dynamic. Elliott goes for broke on the penultimate ball of the match and his sweet strike soars into the stands . Steyn, for many the world's best fast bowler, stands with his hands on his knees as Elliott celebrates . Elliott shakes hands and consoles Steyn as the conclusion of the match at Auckland's Eden Park . The batsman sparked memories of Andrew Flintoff's sportsmanship with Brett Lee in the 2007 Ashes . Elliott has never been seen as the epitome of modern 50-over power and nor has Martin Guptill, who came of age as a limited-overs batsman with his double century in the quarter-final against West Indies. If they can do it, then why not England, if they throw off the shackles and start again in one-day cricket after their embarrassing exit in the group stages? New Zealand were in all sorts of turmoil two years ago when they messily sacked Ross Taylor as captain but what has happened since has been little short of phenomenal, and they will provide the stiffest of opposition to England in both Test and one-day cricket in May and June. Before his semi-final heroics, Elliott was best known for his collision with Ryan Sidebottom in 2008 . Then captain Paul Collingwood apologised for upholding the appeal that saw Elliott run out after the clash . This was heartbreaking for South Africa, who did little to shake off their reputation as perennial chokers on the big occasion. Yet to use the ‘c-word’ they hate so much would be harsh on South Africa. They fumbled two crucial run-out chances and then saw JP Duminy and Farhaan Behardien collide in the deep (above) when Eliott offered a skyer with 14 needed for victory, but were simply beaten by the better team. ‘I really did feel the pressure, it was stressful towards the end,’ said Elliott, who saw New Zealand home in company with the veteran Dan Vettori. That was of little consolation to South Africa captain AB de Villiers, who struggled to contain his emotions after coming off second best in one of the great World Cup games. ‘We wanted to take the trophy home and lift our nation’s hearts but we weren’t able to do that,’ said De Villiers. ‘But life moves on and the sun will come up tomorrow.’","South Africa-born Grant Elliott hit match-winning 84 not out in semi-final .

The animal was tamed after being rescued as a four-month-old cub and was raised as a domestic pet by owner Emma D'Sylva. Since then the lovable fox has picked up a number of canine characteristics such as tail wagging, playing with toys and even walking on a lead. Scroll down for video . Beloved pet: Emma D'Sylva and Todd the fox, who she rescued as a cub and raised as a domestic pet . The 11-month-old animal accompanies Ms D'Sylva's pet labradors Sky and Oakley on walks, drawing double-takes from other dog-walkers when they see Todd trotting through the local park. He also sleeps in a kennel in his enclosure in the garden, plays energetically with the other dogs and even wags his tail when it's feeding time. Emma, 25, from Stanfield, Stoke-on-Trent, Staffs., said: 'Todd has been captive-bred so he has never been in the wild. 'I've had him since he was about four months old because his previous owners couldn't look after him any more. Canine customs: Todd enjoys going on walks, playing with dog toys and even wags his tail when he's happy . Sleeps in a kennel: The 11-month-old domesticated animal spends his nights in a plastic kennel with blankets . 'I get people coming over to me asking if he is a fox and if they can stroke him. 'He was a bit crazy when he first came to me last year but now he has a really strong bond with me and he will walk on a lead. 'He is very playful with me. He will run up to me wagging his tail when I go to feed him and he will roll over to have his belly tickled. 'He will come into the house but he has got a purpose built enclosure and he much prefers being outside. 'We got him a little plastic kennel in his enclosure with blankets which is similar to a dog bed. 'He is similar to a dog but he is a bit more hyperactive. He gets on with my two dogs, and wants to play with them all the time. Playful: The fox, pictured in the park with Ms D'Sylva, cannot be let off the lead because he is deaf . School visits: Ms D'Sylva has 40 pets and takes some of them, including Todd, into schools and care homes so that children and the elderly can interact with them . 'He tries to do what the dogs do but I can't let him off the lead because he's deaf so I can't shout him to come back. 'At first he was bonkers but he is getting more used to being in the company of other people now. 'If people or dogs come up to him in the park he will lie down at first and freeze but after a few seconds he will sniff around the dogs or sit patiently.' Todd also lives with Emma's menagerie of other creatures at her three-bedroomed house including a skunk, a raccoon, lizards and snakes. She takes some of her 40 pets into schools and care homes to enable children and the elderly to interact with a range of captive-bred animals. Emma, who lives with her partner Steve Johnson, 34, added: 'Todd went out on his first school visit the other week and the children really enjoyed stroking him while he was in my arms. Walking companions: Todd is pictured in the woods with Ms D'Sylva's two labradors Sky and Oakley . 'He's really getting used to things now and I'm looking forward to letting more and more people meet him.' An RSPCA spokesperson said there were no legal restrictions on people keeping animals and pets in England and Wales as long as they were treated well. He added: 'Foxes have not been domesticated and a fox in captivity would have the same needs as in the wild. 'Anyone who keeps these animals is under a legal obligation to meet their needs under the Animal Welfare Act 2006.'","Todd the fox tamed after being rescued as cub and raised as domestic pet .

50f309d789f0a7a27ca49fb80976b6b34fd084c5,"(CNN)I met Kelly Gissendaner in January 2010 in a nondescript classroom at Metro State Prison for Women in Atlanta. She arrived for class beaming with excitement about the journey she was about to begin -- participation in a yearlong academic theology program sponsored jointly by four Atlanta seminaries. Since she has been sentenced to the death penalty and lives in solitary confinement, Kelly was particularly eager to share community with others, if only one morning a week. And she was grateful for the opportunity to explore the Bible and theology in a rigorous manner that would nurture and deepen her devotional life. That image of her on the first day of class remains vivid to me because it captures the core of who Kelly is — who she has become: someone full of contagious joy and gratitude, open to others and to new experiences for growth and ministry. Kelly's process of transformation began shortly after she arrived in prison following her conviction for murder in the death of her husband, Doug Gissendaner. A pastor began visiting her and initiated a series of difficult, yet compassionate, conversations that urged her toward courageous self-reflection. This same pastor has been visiting Kelly for almost 16 years. Her commitment to Kelly, along with that of the prison chaplain and chaplaincy interns, provided steady, ongoing love that fostered change. So by the time I met Kelly in 2010 she had already undergone a significant transformation. She was, in the words of the Apostle Paul, a ""new creation"" (2 Cor. 5:17). In the theology program, Kelly found her own voice and came to see that her reflections on Christian faith could be a gift to the wider church ""on the outside,"" as well as in prison. By studying historical and contemporary Christian thinkers, Kelly became part of the conversations that make the Christian tradition dynamic. She asked honest questions about her relationship to God, others and the world. She read scripture and grappled with centuries-old theological questions. She discovered her authentic theological voice in the midst of this work. ""From the start of the theology class I felt this hunger,"" she said in her 2011 graduation speech. ""I became so hungry for theology, and what all the classes had to offer; you could call me a glutton."" One of the great joys of being a theology professor is getting to know students holistically, not only as thinkers, but also as human beings wrestling with some of life's most urgent questions. My relationship with Kelly had this quality from the start. But it deepened six months into the year when a new warden arrived at the prison. In her graduation speech, Kelly described this moment: . ""There came a time when ... my worst fears became my reality -- I was pulled from the courses. I was taken from my theological community. Being pulled from the program devastated me as badly as if someone had just told me one of my appeals had been turned down. ""Since I couldn't go to the theology class ... the instructors came to me. Still, this was far from being ideal because now I had to have class and community through a gate. It was hard ... but I pushed on. I pushed on because of that hunger. That gate ... was meant to keep everyone and everything separated from me. But that gate couldn't keep out the knowledge that I was so hungry for, nor friendship and community. And it sure couldn't keep out God."" This change afforded us the chance to have two hours of one-on-one conversation every Friday. We continued to read theological texts together, including a book by then-Archbishop of Canterbury Rowan Williams. Williams describes healing and restoration as the act of facing our painful memories, ""the ruins of the past,"" and building from them here and now. Restoration, Williams writes, ""is going back to the memories of the painful, humiliating past and bringing them to redemption in the present ... to Christ [who] comes to repair the devastation."" I sat with Kelly as she went back over some of her own painful memories, took responsibility for them and showed profound remorse about who she had been and what she had done. Indeed, the power of these moments -- when Kelly looked me in the eye and confessed concrete sins, when we spoke of God's love and forgiveness -- will stay with me forever. Kelly embraced what Dietrich Bonhoeffer, a German pastor-theologian and Nazi resister, calls ""costly grace."" For Bonhoeffer, ""cheap grace"" is seeking God's forgiveness as a ""cover-up for one's sins, for which one has no remorse and ... even less desire to be set free."" In contrast, costly grace requires rigorously following Jesus in a way that leads to continuous, visible transformation, what the New Testament calls the fruits of redemption. The fruits of Kelly's redemption are now well-documented: reconciliation with her children, ministry to inmates full of despair, counsel to troubled youth and daily concern for others. On the night Kelly thought would be her last, she spent the evening writing a letter to her fellow inmates, urging them not to worry about her, but to be encouraged. Most poignant for Kelly are the writings of German theologian Jürgen Moltmann, who is widely known as the ""theologian of hope"" and with whom Kelly began corresponding in 2010. Moltmann shows that biblical hope is not a hope that gives up on this life and looks for something better beyond the grave. Rather, hope makes manifest the kingdom of God now --God's intended social order ""on earth as it is in heaven"" (Matt. 6:10). Biblical hope ""revolutionizes and transforms the present.""  It is the hope of the psalmist who ""looks for the goodness of God in this life"" (Ps. 27:13).  In the words of Kelly's favorite scripture, it is a hope that proclaims: ""I shall not die but live, and declare the works of the Lord"" (Ps 118:17). In Kelly's own words: . ""The theology program has shown me that hope is still alive and that, despite a gate or a guillotine hovering over my head, I still possess the ability to prove that I am human. Labels on anyone can be notoriously misleading and unforgiving things. But no matter the label attached to me, I have the capacity and the unstoppable desire to accomplish something positive and have a lasting impact ... Even prison cannot erase my hope or conviction that the future is not settled for me, or anyone."" Many people have asked me in recent days how I have been transformed by my friendship with Kelly and by Kelly's journey of hope. While I struggle to find adequate words, what I do know is that Kelly's story pushes the logic of Christian faith to its outermost limits. It pushes Christians to reexamine and reaffirm the truths we proclaim about repentance, forgiveness, redemption and hope. Indeed, even professional theologians and life-long pastors struggle with the weight of the claims we make. Today, Kelly's life hangs in the balance. The state of Georgia on Monday issued a last-minute postponement of her execution, citing concerns about the drugs that were to be used to kill her. The Department of Corrections has said that it plans to resume executions once an analysis of the drugs is complete. While Gov. Nathan Deal does not have the formal power to commute Kelly's sentence to life in prison, I join more than 1,100 faith leaders from across the nation, including more than 500 from Georgia, who have signed a letter urging the governor to use his political influence to save Kelly's life and to speak out publicly against her execution. I call on all people of good will to reach out to Gov. Deal and to Georgia state legislators to demand a more just, merciful, and accountable system of justice -- for Kelly and for all. As theologian Richard Amesbury wrote, ""If the life even of a convicted murderer can be turned around and so radically redirected, then none of us is without hope."" We need to hear Kelly Gissendaner proclaim to us -- as much as we proclaim to her -- that the promises of God are real.","The execution of Kelly Gissendaner was postponed due to concerns over injection drugs .

Packages of matzos roll off the assembly line at the factory. The factory has annual sales topping $20million as Streit's matzos are sold around the country and worldwide . 'For decades, immigrant Jews and their descendants have made pilgrimages back to the Lower East Side, the Jewish Plymouth Rock, to reconnect with their history and, of course, delight in the shopping and eating that gives the neighborhood its flavor,' said Annie Polland, a historian at the Lower East Side Tenement Museum. 'With the Streit's closure, you have a significant chapter of Jewish Lower East Side history closing.' Tradition is quickly disappearing in the neighborhood that was home to Jewish immigrants for much of the 20th century. Property values have skyrocketed, with galleries, boutiques and restaurants opening in renovated tenements. The Streit's property, up for sale, is worth tens of millions of dollars. In the neighborhood, the factory will leave behind places like Katz's Delicatessen, Russ and Daughters and Yonah Schimmel among the remnants of the traditional Lower East Side, according to the New York Times. The pressure of gentrification, however, is not what has caused the closing of the factor, said Alan M. Adler, a great-grandson of Aron Streit, who started the business after emigrating from Austria. 'The reality is that operating a modern factory in four old buildings has finally caught up with us,' Adler told the New York Times in January. Worker Aharon Yakov loads fresh baked matzos into a packaging machine at Streit's matzo factory . This early 1960s photo shows the storefront of the matzo factory at the corner of Rivington St. and Suffolk St. in New York's Lower East Side . Another photo from the early 1960s shows a rabbi, center, supervising the Passover matzo production at the factory, and pictured right is Aron Gross, the great-great grandson of the company founder Aron Streit . For many workers like Adramov, the Streit's factory has provided a steady job for 25 years, in fact, his only job since coming to America from Uzbekistan . The bakery first opened during World War I, serving struggling Jewish immigrants. By 1925, the business moved to Rivington Street, where the original assembly line winds through four six-story buildings — once overcrowded tenements with narrow, rickety stairs that are still used. However, the 48,000-square-foot factory does not live off nostalgia, as it is a smartly run family business with annual sales topping $20million on about 5million pounds of matzos sold around the country and worldwide. The other mass U.S. manufacturer of matzos is Manischewitz, with Israeli imports and traditional round handmade crackers also filling store shelves. Demand is growing for matzos even among non-Jews who enjoy them as a healthy snack baked with no fat or artificial additives. The old factory simply cannot keep up with demand, said Aaron Gross, head of sales and marketing at Streit's and one of three cousins running the day-to-day operations. 'I'm fifth generation, and if we want this to last another five generations, we need to make sure that we strengthen the company to remain relevant in a very competitive market,' said Gross, the great-great grandson of Streit. 'The name Streit's conjures up so many happy memories of not only my childhood but of the decades since,' says Karen Kriendler Nelson, whose relatives organized a pre-Passover family reunion at the factory. The current Streit's production line dates back to the 1930s and the baking process is strictly timed. It may take no more than 18 minutes from the moment the flour and water are mixed to when matzos emerge from a gas-fired, tunnel-like oven to cool in metal baskets that hang off rusty tracks, inching slowly to the packaging operation. Workers from the Lower East Side factory have already been offered jobs at the new location (above a pallet of matzos sits in the factory) Operations on Rivington Street will continue until the new plant is up and running (above Caballeros loads fresh baked matzos into a packaging machine) Beyond the 18 minutes, the dough rises, forbidden for this food that symbolizes the biblical flight of the Jews from Egypt, who were so rushed they had no time to finish baking their 'bread of affliction.' 'Nothing changes at Streit's,' declared Rabbi Mayer Kirshner, who oversees the factory's kosher certification. Some of the nearly 60 workers represent a wave of immigrants from former Soviet republics, like machine operator Michael Abramov, who was born in Uzbekistan. He has been at Streit's for 25 years — the only job he has ever had in America. 'I'm not bored. I love this work. This is important. It's our religion, it's the history of the Jews,' said the 61-year-old Queens resident. Operations on Rivington Street will proceed until the new plant is running with state-of-the-art equipment that will speed up production. These are not your great-grandmother's matzos, kneaded and shaped by hand. Mass-produced and machine-packaged, they are a modern effort to preserve tradition. The employees are all being offered jobs at the new location, where Streit's will preserve its motto — 'the taste of a memory.' In the neighborhood, property values have skyrocketed, with galleries, boutiques and restaurants opening in renovated tenements (above the iconic Katz's Deli in New York shares the same neighborhood as Streit's factory) As the factory closes its doors, it leaves behind places like Russ and Daughters (above) and Yonah Schimmel among the remnants of the traditional Lower East Side .","Streit's matzos factory in Manhattan is shutting down its nine-decade-old ovens by year's end to move to 21st century computerized plant in another part of the New York area .

6c1fb1595a4d6f37c008404157593011641aae22,"Washington (CNN)Democrats who have gleefully watched Republican infighting for years are about to feel some heat of their own. As the party works to retake control of the Senate in 2016, Democrats are looking at a Senate landscape that could feature titanic intraparty clashes starring big personalities who have been waiting years for a shot at the big time. It's a big shift from recent years when Republicans, riven by long-standing ideological fault lines, faced divisive and attention-grabbing primaries, usually pitting a party favorite against insurgents from the conservative grassroots. Memorably, in 2010 and 2012, the fights were so damaging that Republicans failed to pick up winnable Senate seats by nominating flagrantly unprepared candidates. Democrats, for the most part, have not had to face the same problem. But that might be changing. While the fields of candidates are still taking shape, a platoon of Democrats are mulling Senate bids in Ohio, Florida, Maryland, California, Pennsylvania and Illinois. While many of them have yet to formally declare campaigns, none possess the kind of field-clearing star power that could help Democrats avoid a primary bonanza, and few show signs of putting their ambitions aside for the sake of party unity. Republican primary battles aren't going anywhere in 2016, and on the presidential level, Democrats continue to line up behind Hillary Clinton as their nominee, without a whiff a serious primary challenge. But there is a different story unfolding in the next race for the Senate, where the question is whether Democrats will cleave along ideological and generational lines in primary fights, jeopardizing the party's hopes of regaining control of the the Upper Chamber. ""The great irony of Democrats celebrating fissures amongst Republicans in recent years is that historically they're much less capable of confronting the extreme elements within their party than the GOP,"" said Josh Holmes, a former top strategist to Republican Senate Leader Mitch McConnell. ""Now we're watching several years of pent-up liberal aggression about to spill into divisive primaries that will undoubtedly complicate things considerably for their Senate chances."" Democrats scoff at the idea, claiming that no potential candidate has the ability to fumble away a Senate win against the many Republicans up for re-election next year. Of the nine Senate seats rated as toss-up or competitive the Rothenberg & Gonzales Political Report, seven of them are held by Republicans elected in the tea party wave of 2010. Democrats need a net gain of five seats to take back the Senate. ""Unfortunately for the numerous vulnerable Republican senators, there are no Todd Akins here, and there isn't a single state on the map with a Democratic primary that will negatively impact our ability win the state,"" said Justin Barasky, the Democratic Senatorial Campaign Committee's communications director. Akin, of course, was the GOP nominee in Missouri in 2012 who derailed his own campaign with a comment about ""legitimate rape."" Last cycle, Barasky said, Democrats witnessed hotly contested Senate primaries in New Jersey, Massachusetts and Hawaii. All of those fights were in blue states, of course. But none of them resulted in a November loss for Democrats. Republicans, though, are hoping to breathe life into the narrative, especially with Democratic primaries brewing in the competitive states of Florida and Ohio. ""Democrats are facing messy primaries in key Senate races across the country, and there doesn't seem to be any end in sight,"" said Andrea Bozek, communications director for the National Republican Senatorial Committee. ""The infighting is so bad that it's not just limited to candidates in key races, but is even playing out between Harry Reid and the DSCC in Washington."" The most crowded lane, for now, appears to be in Maryland, where five-term Sen. Barbara Mikulski is retiring. In a state that reliably goes blue in federal elections, the retirement has at long last opened a door for a raft of Democrats in Congress eyeing higher office. With the exception of House Democratic Whip Steny Hoyer, nearly every Democrat in Maryland's eight-member congressional delegation has signaled some kind of interest in the Senate seat. NAACP President Benjamin Jealous and Baltimore Mayor Stephanie Rawlings-Blake have also been floated as contenders. Despite the microscopic ideological differences between the likely candidates, the race has already been heralded as a battle between the party's play-it-safe establishment and its restive liberal wing. Harry Reid, the Democratic leader in the Senate, declined to stay neutral and promptly endorsed Rep. Chris Van Hollen for the seat, a sign that the national party apparatus might be in his corner. The DSCC, however, has not picked a side in the race. Progressive groups, meanwhile, have championed a known figure from their community: Rep. Donna Edwards, who joined the race last week vowing to protect Social Security and Medicare, ""no ifs ands buts or willing-to-considers."" That was seen as a poke at Van Hollen, who said in 2012 he was ""willing to consider"" entitlement changes as part of deficit negotiations. But even if the primary turns into a pitched battle over progressive priorities, there is little chance the nomination fight would hinder Democratic hopes in Maryland, which hasn't seen a GOP senator since Charles Mathias in 1987. And Mathias, a civil rights advocate and skeptic of Ronald Reagan, was one of the most liberal members of the Republican Party. Republicans are also hoping for Democratic carnage in Ohio, where Sen. Rob Portman is up for re-election. National Democrats have endorsed former Gov. Ted Strickland for the nomination, but the news did not force P.G. Sittenfeld, an up-and-coming 30-year-old Cincinnati city councilman, out of the race. Democrats are skeptical that Sittenfeld can raise the kind of money to compete against Strickland and Portman, but if he does, his candidacy will make for a stark contrast against the 73-year old Strickland. In an interview, Sittenfeld spoke critically of Portman, calling him ""a 25-year creature of Washington"" who is ""out of touch"" with Ohio. But the next-generation rhetoric could also stir inevitable questions about Strickland's age. ""I fit the mold for new leadership,"" Sittenfeld told CNN in an interview, careful to note his admiration for Strickland and stressing that he is running against Portman. ""If you put together 100 people into the Senate, wouldn't you want at least one person from the largest generation in American history, the most technologically savvy generation in American history?"" Sittenfeld asked. ""How can we invest  in technology and innovation to solve problems when we are rehashing stale battles?"" As in Maryland, there appear to be no major early-stage differences between Strickland and Sittenfeld on the issues, which again suggests that the Democratic primary boom of 2016 is more about timing and opportunity than anything else. With a presidential election on the ballot, increased voter turnout is expected to give Democrats a lift in the general election. ""There is an ideological reason for running, but let's not separate that from a path to victory,"" said Nathan Gonzales, editor of the Gonzales & Rothenberg Report. ""Primaries happen when multiple candidates see a good opportunity. Democrats have good opportunities in multiple states this cycle, specifically in Maryland. The Democratic nomination is incredibly valuable because Maryland is a Democratic state. Lots of candidates see paths to victory and think, 'Why not me? Why not now?' "" And while primaries can drain financial resources and drive uncomfortable headlines, the contests are not necessarily damaging, Gonzales said. ""Crowded and expensive primaries do not prohibit general election victory,"" he said. ""That doesn't mean that a party can't win."" Brad Todd, a Republican consultant who worked on several top tier Senate races in 2014, said the primaries might boost Democrats. ""Some of those primaries will animate elements of their base, including some donors, more than the general elections,"" he said. But Todd said the rush of primary activity for Democrats does not compare to the pitched tea party-versus-establishment battles that have roiled his party for years. ""I don't see that happening with Democrats as much as it does with Republicans since all of their candidates are pretty much orthodox liberals,"" he said. ""There's no such thing as a centrist Democrat anymore, so there won't be nearly as many sabers to rattle against them in primaries.""","Recently, it's been Republicans who have been in attention-getting, bruising primaries .

057123b34979f7c0bdc7ba28af13c1eb2ec215d9,"The Internal Revenue Service's $10.9 billion annual budget is so puny that it's ignoring 60 per cent of phone calls from people who are working on their tax return who have questions in advance of the April 15 filing deadline. John Koskinen, the agency's commissioner, said Tuesday during a speech at the National Press Club in Washington, D.C. that $346 million in budget cuts this year has caused a noticeable negative impact on taxpayer service.' 'This year we were forced to substantially reduce hiring of extra seasonal help we usually bring in during the filing season,' Koskinen said. 'As a result, the phone level of service is now below 40 per cent.' SCROLL DOWN FOR VIDEO . CRY POVERTY: IRS Commissioner John Koskinen told a National Press Club audience that $10.9 billion is too small a budget to guarantee that taxpayers who call with questions hear a voice on the other end of the line . 'TIS THE SEASON: Tax returns for 2014 are due on April 15 . 'That means that six out of every 10 people who call can't reach a customer service representative,' said Koskinen. 'This truly is an abysmal level of service.' Koskinen wasn't ceding new ground in Americans' hate-hate relationship with the IRS. He was arguing that Congress should give his agency more money. 'We are aware of taxpayers lining up outside some of our offices many hours before they open,' he said. 'You would think, in fact, we must be selling something like the Apple watch when you look at the lines. This is not a new story this year; it’s just gotten worse.' Overall, Koskinen complained, 'the IRS is now the lowest level of funding since 2008,' resulting in 'fewer audits and collection cases' and costing the U.S. Treasury at least $2 billion in revenue. CAN'T BE ABOLISHED: Presidential canididate Sen. Ted Cruz (pictured in New Hampshrie on March 27) has campaigned on the idea of doing away with the IRS, but Koskinen said Tuesday that it can't be done – although 'you can call it something other than the IRS if that makes you feel better' Congress has weighed that number, though, against a much larger sum of money that has gone out the door to tax fraud scammers. In 2013, the last year for which reliable numbers are available, the IRS paid out $5.8 billion in fake tax refunds to identity thieves. Law enforcement crackdowns have taken 'a lot of the amateurs off the street, but we are clearly dealing with organized crime syndicates here and around the world,' the commissioner said. And the IRS itself gets 'millions of attacks on our system every year,' he griped, due to some software packages the IRS has been using since 'when JFK was president.' 'About the only good thing you can say about them,' Koskinen joked, 'is that the code they use has been out of date for so long that it has the unintended effect of creating problems for any hackers who might try to figure out how the system actually works.' The IRS has been hammered in recent years after investigations revealed lavish spending on employee conferences for its employees, including one featuring am expensively produced Star Trek parody video. Another bone of contention among lawmakers who set Koskinen's budget has been the practice, now discontinued, of paying performance bonuses to at least 1,100 agency employees who themselves owe delinquent taxes. THE IRS, the federal government agency Americans most love to hate, has had its wings clipped by Congress following a series of spending scandals including lavish employee conferences and bonuses paid to tax cheats . Rhode Island Republican Rep. Ander Crenshaw, who chairs the congressional appropriations subcommittee that oversees the IRS, warned the commissioner this year that the House of Representatives nas taken note. 'We deliberately lowered the IRS funding to a level that will make the IRS think twice about what you are doing and why you are doing it,' Crenshaw told him, because you don’t have a single dime to spare on anything frivolous or foolhardy or even mediocre.' Tax returns for individual filers are due in two weeks, but six-month extensions are available. Still, most Americans find America's tax laws confusing enough to rely on tax-preparation software or professional preparers to help them navigate the waters, leading to frustration and now-legendary resentment. 'The IRS code is longer than the Bible,' Koskinen said Tuesday, 'with none of the good news.'","John Koskinen revealed the startling statistic during a speech at the National Press Club .

1b7fa41fe8546787903a66933c92298127086033,"If you’re a Saturnian, it’s time to reset your clocks because it’s been discovered that a day lasts just 10 hours, 32 minutes and 45 seconds - seven minutes shorter than previously thought. Saturn’s rotation period - the time it takes to rotate once around its axis - has been notoriously difficult to estimate in the past because of the planet’s unique properties. But using measurements of the ringed planet’s gravitational field combined with its shape and density, scientists have determined a more exact value for a day on the planet. Scientists in Israel have revealed a new estimated rotation speed for the ringed planet (shown). Previously it was thought to rotate in 10 hours, 39 minutes and 22 seconds. But new figure of 10 hours, 32 minutes and 45 seconds is more accurate. This is based on measuring its gravitational field, shape and density . The research was carried out by scientists at Tel Aviv University in Israel. Radio measurements by the Voyager spacecraft had estimated Saturn's day at 10 hours, 39 minutes and 22.4 seconds in the 1980s. In 2006, astronomers used more advanced equipment to measure the planet's rotation ending up with a measurement of about 10 hours and 47 minutes. But an estimate that was 12 minutes shorter in 2009 only added to the confusion. Mercury: 58 days and 15 hours . Venus: 243 days . Earth: 23 hours, 56 minutes, 4 seconds . Mars: 24 hours, 39 minutes, 35 seconds . Jupiter: 9.9 hours . Saturn: 10 hours, 32 minutes and 45 seconds . Uranus: 17 hours, 14 minutes and 24 seconds . Neptune: 16 hours, 6 minutes and 36 seconds . The new method, though, provides what might be the most accurate reading so far. Gas giants - such as Saturn and Jupiter - do not have solid objects on their surface that allow their rotation period to be observed, so other methods of finding this property must be found. The same formula came up with the correct rotation period of Jupiter - which was already known owing to its tilted magnetic field. Saturn’s magnetic pole is aligned with its rotational axis and this means - unlike Jupiter - its rotation period cannot be calculated using the magnetic field alone. But verifying the method with Jupiter allowed scientists to apply the same technique to Saturn. Alternative methods such as measuring Saturn’s radio emissions or wind field, or tracking the planet’s clouds, had only served to increase uncertainty and resulted in a rotation period of between 10 hours and 32 minutes and 10 hours and 47 minutes. The same method came up with the correct rotation period of Jupiter (pictured) - which was already known owing to its tilted magnetic field. Verifying the method with Jupiter allowed scientists to apply the same technique to Saturn and come up with the revised estimate . Scientists used measurements of the ringed planet’s gravitational field combined with its shape and density, some of which was gathered by the Cassini spacecraft in orbit (artist's illustration shown) ‘The alignment of Saturn’s magnetic pole with its rotation axis precludes the use of magnetic field measurements to determine its rotation period,’ said planetary scientist Dr Ravit Helled of Tel Aviv University. ‘Here we report a period of 10 hours 32 minutes 45 seconds (plus or minus 46 seconds) based upon an optimisation approach using Saturn’s measured gravitational field and limits on the observed shape and possible internal density profiles. ‘To validate our method we applied the same procedure to Jupiter and correctly recovered its well-known rotation period.’ Gas giants - such as Saturn and Jupiter - do not have solid objects on their surface that allow their rotation period to be observed, so other methods of finding this property must be found. The study, published online in Nature, could be used in the future to derive the rotation period of other giant planets and planets outside our solar system.","Scientists in Israel have revealed new rotation speed for the ringed planet .

001db2e0e30e54bc5effda388ffb51425d018caf,"A New Zealand bar manager and his two Myanmar colleagues were jailed for two and a half years with hard labour by a Yangon court Tuesday for using a Buddha image to promote a cheap drinks night. The ad posted on Facebook in December caused a stir of outrage in the former junta-ruled country, where surging Buddhist nationalism and religious violence has sparked international concern. Philip Blackwood, who worked at the VGastro bar in Yangon, was found guilty of insulting religion along with the bar's Myanmar owner and manager, after the New Zealander posted a mocked-up photo of the Buddha wearing DJ headphones on Facebook — in reference to a well-known international club brand. The 32-year-old was arrested by Myanmar police in December, along with owner Tun Thurein, 40, and manager Htut Ko Ko Lwin, 26, after an official from Myanmar's Religious Department complained about the advertising. The bar has since been shuttered-up. Scroll down for video . Philip Blackwood (C) is escorted by police to a court hearing in Yangon. Blackwood and his two Myanmar colleagues were sentenced  to two and a half years in jail for using a Buddha image to promote a cheap drinks . In emotional scenes after the verdict, family members of the two Myanmar defendants expressed shock and fury at the sentencing, with the mother of one exchanging barbs with a handful of nationalist monks waiting outside. The case has been watched closely by international observers amid fears that the Buddhist-majority country, which has seen a surge in foreign investment since it began emerging from the grip of the military in 2011, is seeing its much-lauded reforms stalling. Blackwood, who has a seven month old daughter, along with 40-year-old bar owner Tun Thurein and manager Htut Ko Ko Lwin, 26, have been held in Yangon's notorious Insein prison since their arrest in December. Mr Blackwood leaves court after being sentenced to two and half years in prison. He was found guilty of insulting Buddhism . Blackwood, the manager of VGastro Bar in Yangon, was arrested  after posting a promotional image of a psychedelic Buddha wearing headphones to the bar's Facebook page . The trio, who all denied the charges, were sentenced to two years in jail for insulting religion through written word or pictures and a further six months for breaching local authority regulations. Both offences carry the punishment of hard labour. They were also held responsible for protests that erupted outside the bar over the image. Judge Ye Lwin said that while Blackwood, 32, had posted an apology, he had 'intentionally plotted to insult religious belief' when he uploaded the photo. He added that although the New Zealander had admitted to posting the picture without intending to offend, it was also 'unreasonable only to blame the foreigner' when explaining the guilty verdicts for the Myanmar defendants.

VGastro Bar employee Htut Ko Ko Lwin is escorted to a police vehicle after appearing in court in Yangon on Thursday. The trio could face two years in jail for breaching Myanmar's Religion Act . Htut Ko Ko Lwin's mother screamed at a group of monks taking photos with smartphones outside the court after the sentencing. The wife of bar owner Tun Thurein said she would consult her lawyer about appealing. 'They just decided everybody is guilty so I'm very shocked. This is very unfair,' Myat Nandar said. Blackwood made no comment as he was bundled into the back of a police truck through a scrum of media cameras. Myanmar has been rocked by several deadly outbreaks of religious violence in recent years, mainly targeting the Muslim minority. The bloodshed has coincided with the rising influence of hardline monks, who have advocated controversial new laws. Rights groups say these would severely curb the freedom of religious minorities and women. V Gastro bar, which opened just two weeks before the incident, swiftly deleted the offending image and posted this apology on its Facebook page . Phil Robertson, deputy Asia director of Human Rights Watch, said Tuesday's sentences showed 'freedom of expression is under greater threat than ever' in Myanmar, which is gearing up for crucial elections later this year. 'The authorities should accept the heartfelt public apology of the three men, vacate the conviction, and order them to be released immediately and unconditionally,' he said in a statement. Blackwood's parents told Fairfax Media from their New Zealand home that they were shocked by the decision and their son would consider an appeal. 'We hoped common sense would prevail and he would be found not guilty because it was not a malicious or intentional act...' said father Brian Blackwood. The arrests come during a surge of religious nationalism in Myanmar, a predominantly Buddhist country .","Philip Blackwood was jailed for two and a half years with hard labour .

Instead, she says the company relies  on a secretive 'shoulder tap' process that allows few women to achieve the top engineering positions. In the legal papers Miss Huang allegedly argues that 79 per cent of Twitter's leadership team is male, according to Mashable. Miss Hiss Huang complained to Twitter CEO Dick Costolo, pictured . Miss Hunag is one of Twitter's oldest employees after joining the firm in October 2009. She was put on leave after she raised a grievance with CEO Dick Costolo about her lack of promotion and quit in June 2014. 'Despite being one of Twitter's oldest employees, Ms. Huang's career at Twitter was irreparably derailed for making a complaint, court documents says, according to Business Insider. 'After three months without explanation as to the status of the investigation, or mention of any possible time frame for her return to work, she felt she had no choice but to leave the company for the sake of her career.' She is now seeking other employees at the firm who feel they have been passed over for promotion to join her in the lawsuit. A spokesman for Twitter said Miss Huang had resigned and was not forced out. 'Twitter is deeply committed to a diverse and supportive workplace, and we believe the facts will show Ms Huang was treated fairly,' they said. Miss Huang started her legal action as the case was being heard of Ellen Pao, a former partner at venture capital firm Kleiner Perkins Caulfield and Byers, who is suing for sexual discrimination. During the high-profile trial in San Francisco she has claimed she was passed over for promotion because she is a woman. She alleges that she was fired in 2012 after she complained. The firm deny her claims of sexual discrimination and harassment. At the weekend a judge denied a request by lawyers for Kleiner Perkins Caufield & Byers to have Pao's demand for unspecified punitive damages thrown out. Judge Harold Kahn said: 'There is sufficient evidence from which a reasonable juror could conclude that Kleiner Perkins engaged in intentional gender discrimination by failing to promote Ms. Pao and terminating her employment,' the judge said in the one-paragraph decision. Pao can seek punitive damages that could add millions of dollars to a possible verdict in her favour. She is seeking $16 million in lost wages and bonuses. Meanwhile, Facebook is also facing a lawsuit from former employee and program manager Chia Hong. According to the complaint she has filed with San Mateo Court, she was belittled by her boss for taking time off to volunteer at her children's school, forced to served drinks to male co-workers and told she should have just stayed home to take care of her child. Ellen Pao, a former partner at Kleiner Perkins Caufield & Byers, pictured left, and Chia Hong, a former Facebook employee, pictured right,  have put the spot light on gender discrimination in Silicon Valley . A Facebook spokesperson denied the allegations and told Recode that the company has made progress in matters related to gender, diversity, and equality. 'In this case we have substantive disagreements on the facts,' the spokesperson said 'and we believe the record shows the employee was treated fairly.'","Female engineer Tina Huang is suing Twitter for gender discrimination .

The Cherries were in cruise control at the Goldsands as they secured their third straight victory which condemned the Tangerines to a fifth consecutive defeat. Basement side Blackpool came in search of their first win in eight matches but any hopes were dashed after just 10 minutes. Brett Pitman fires Bournemouth into the lead at Goldsands as he scored a first-half hat-trick on Saturday . BOURNEMOUTH (4-4-2): Boruc; Francis, Elphick (Stanislas 63), Cook, Daniels; Ritchie, MacDonald, Surman, Pugh (Smith 62); Pitman, Wilson (Rantie 79) Subs not used: Camp, Rantie, Fraser, Ward, O'Kane .

Referee: Chris Sarginson . Attendance: 10,013 . Jersey-born striker Pitman was afforded time and space to run past a sea of Tangerine players before slotting past goalkeeper Elliot Parish. Pitman turned down Blackpool in favour of a move to Bristol City in 2010 and ensured the Seasiders - without an away win all season - had another miserable trip home. Blackpool's first attack on Artur Boruc's goal came after 22 minutes when debutant Michael Jacobs won his side a corner which came to nothing. Bournemouth captain Tommy Elphick could have doubled his side's lead after 28 minutes but he headed over from a Matt Ritchie free-kick. Tangerines supporters jeered their side and chairman Karl Oyston throughout and had only Andrea Orlandi's wayward effort to get excited about. Pitman (centre) runs away in celebration as the Blackpool players watch on in frustration at Goldsands . He scooped over after Nathan Delfouneso backheeled for the Seasiders skipper after 31 minutes. A minute later Tom Aldred cleared the ball after Ritchie had teed up Pitman inside the box. But Pitman was not kept at bay long and scored two goals in two minutes to complete his hat-trick inside 39 minutes. The Cherries striker first headed back across goal from a Ritchie cross before drilling low past Parish from a free-kick routine. Eddie Howe's side continued their dominance in the second period as they found the net once more four minutes into the second-half. Blackpool midfielder Orlandi tripped winger Marc Pugh in the box and Callum Wilson scored his 19th of the season from the resulting spot-kick. Blackpool manager Lee Clark instructs his side during the comprehensive 4-0 defeat at Bournemouth . Ritchie easily evaded Tangerines defender Charles Dunne before finding Pitman once more who skewed over on 59 minutes. Bournemouth were in total control and manager Howe even opted to withdraw skipper Elphick after just an hour as the Cherries began to ease off. Substitutes Junior Stanislas and Adam Smith did combine with the latter's effort forcing Parish into a smart save with 15 minutes to go. Smith then ran past Dunne before the legs of Parish kept out his effort. The Tangerines are the lowest scorers in the division and failed to register a single shot on target at the Goldsands. Blackpool striker Delfouneso went closest when he headed wide on 78 minutes after Orlandi whipped in a free-kick. The Cherries won 6-1 away at Blackpool in December and almost echoed that goal haul when Stanislas and Pitman both went close in the final minutes before Blackpool defender Aldred blazed over his stoppage-time effort.","27-year-old scored a first-half hat-trick to put 3-0 up at the break .

An Ohio cop has been convicted of animal cruelty for letting his police dog roast to death in his patrol car last year. Sergeant Brett Harrison will not face any jail time. His only punishment: a $500 fine and court costs. The Montville Township officer outraged the community when he left his two-year-old German Shepard Beny in his squad car for four hours with the windows rolled up last September. The dog was found dead in his kennel in the car when Harrison returned. On Wednesday, Judge Dale M. Chase ruled that Harrison was guilty of one of two misdemeanor counts of animal cruelty. Following Beny's death, Harrison publicly apologized and said he had left the car running with his air conditioning on. He said he didn't mean to leave the dog in a hot car. The temperature when the officer arrived on station was 69 degrees and it was 79 degrees when the dog was found. An investigation concluded Harrison violated policy and procedures. The police department suspended him for two weeks without pay and docked him 40 hours of vacation. Montville Police welcomed K9 Officer Beny to the department in September 2013. Beny was trained in narcotics and patrol.  When Harrison returned to the cruiser after leaving him for four hours, he discovered the dog lying lifeless in the rear passenger compartment’s kennel . Sgt. Harrison cared deeply about Beny. He worked with him 40+ hours a week and Beny lived with Sgt. Harrison and his family when the two were off duty. He is said to be overwhelmed with grief . Harrison issued a statement expressing his 'deepest apology' to Montville Township and to his 'partner, friend and loving family member Beny.' 'This is a loss that words cannot describe, and it is very difficult for everyone involved,' said Chief Terry Grice. 'There is no doubt that this loss will have a lasting impact on Sgt. Harrison and our entire department.' A statement from the department also said that Sgt. Harrison cared deeply about Beny. He worked with the dog more than 40 hour a week and Beny lived with Sgt. Harrison and his family when the two were off duty. Sgt. Harrison was overwhelmed with grief and is taking this loss very hard, the chief added. Sgt. Harrison was found to have violated policy and procedures. He received a two-week unpaid suspension and a loss of 40 hours of vacation . Sgt. Brett Harrison didn’t leave the windows open and the cruiser was turned off; the temperature at the time Harrison arrived at the station was 69 degrees and it was 79 degrees when the dog was discovered . Police say Sgt. Harrison has been an exemplary officer who has never received discipline since being hired onto the department in 2007 . Sgt. Harrison had been an exemplary officer who has never received discipline since being hired onto the department on Sept. 11, 2007. He came to the department after serving 10 years in the United States Air National Guard, where he was deployed to Qatar during Operation Enduring Freedom. Over the years, he has received awards and praise from law enforcement leaders for his dedication in getting weapons, drugs, and impaired drivers off the roads. The prosecutor for the SPCA of Medina County is reviewing the case to determine whether criminal charges should be filed against the officer. I want to start by expressing my deepest apology to Montville Township, the Trustees, the citizens, the police department, my fellow officers and to my partner, Beny. I'm sorry to bringing this upon everyone. I apologize to the trustees and police department for putting you all in this horrible position. I know that it is an unenviable position to have to deal with a situation as sad as this. I'm also sorry for the sadness and grief that you were put into. Most of all, I want to say I'm sorry to my partner, friend and loving family member Beny. I wish everyday that I could go back and change that day or that I could put myself in your place. You will always be in my heart and I will miss you every second of every day. I want you all to know that I will never forget any of this. Once again, I am sorry. Sincerely, .

95ea595c04fad8bf16d9c9ce8d4a484702dc6d5a,"A British singer and her husband have been fired from their roles as judges on New Zealand’s X Factor after humiliating a contestant by launching a tirade that the show’s boss slammed as ‘completely unacceptable’. Natalia Kills, from Bradford, and her New Zealander husband Willy Moon, mocked aspiring singer Joe Irvine after he performed in a live show on Sunday. Kills, 28, accused Irvine, who sang Cry Me A River, of copying her husband’s look of gelled-back hair and a suit. Sacked: Married X Factor New Zealand judges Natalia Kills and Willy Moon have been fired after launching a tirade of abuse at contestant, Joe Irvine, on Sunday night's episode . Holding back the tears: Joe Irvine, an aspiring singer, was verbally attacked by the British singer/songwriter and her husband on live television following his rendition of Cry Me A River . She said: 'Ladies and gentlemen, I'm just going to state the obvious, we have a doppelgänger in our midst. 'As an artist who respects creative integrity and intellectual property, I am disgusted at how much you've copied my husband. 'From the hair to the suit, do you not have any value for respect for originality?' alluding to the fact that Moon has copyright over wearing suits and gelling his hair back. She added: ‘You're a laughing stock. It's cheesy, it's disgusting, I personally found it artistically atrocious. 'I am embarrassed to be sitting here in your presence having to even dignify you with an answer of my opinion.' A shocked Irvine retorted: ‘Don’t you copy Cleopatra?’ In the spotlight: Kills accused the aspiring singer of copying her husband's look, seemingly unaware of the fact that slicked-back hair and a suit were hardly original . Double whammy: Moon, 25, stepped in to back up his 28-year-old wifer, and compared Irvine to Psycho character, Norman Bates, asking him whether he dressed up in his mother's clothing . Hubris: Kills said Irvine was 'a laughing stock'. 'It's cheesy, it's disgusting', she said. But it was Kills herself and her husband that ended up being fired . You're killing me: Despite the shocking humiliation, Irvine reacted with a smile and attempted to shake the criticism off, asking Kills, 'don't you copy Cleopatra?' Kills and Moon had earlier caused controversy when they repeatedly called a mother from Auckland the C-word following an argument over a parking space, then refused to apologise. Tracey Neal-Gailer, 51, described how Moon used the abusive term last Tuesday after he reprimanded her for taking a bakery parking space he believed was his in the Auckland suburb of Kingsland. She told The New Zealand Herald: ‘He was a passenger in a car being driven by a woman and he became very upset when I pulled into a space before him, even though I had the right of way. ‘He got out of the car and was waving his finger at me and saying, “No, no, no.” He then snarled, “That was so rude” as we both went into the bakery.’ She said that once they were inside the bakery, with children nearby, Moon twice hissed ‘you are such a c***’. The Herald published a letter that Ms Neal-Gailer wrote to Moon in which she voiced her disgust at his insult. But Moon told the newspaper: ‘I seem to recall someone was behaving like a c*** and getting called a c***. It's as simple as that.’ In a tweet directed at The Herald he repeated the abuse and also disputed the accuracy of Ms Neal-Gailer’s letter, writing ‘not only a **** but a lying **** judging from that ""statement"" you [The Herald] saw fit to print. Laughable. Bored?’ Kills also used the C-word in a tweet to describe Ms Neal-Gailer, it was reported, in which she disputed that children had been within earshot of the swearing. She wrote: ‘Hilarious that lady is proving not only how much of a c*** she is, but also a lying c***! 'Children present'?! Where?!’ X Factor producers TV3 apologised to Ms Neal-Gailer on the pair’s behalf. Then Moon, 25, stepped in to back up his 28-year-old wife, and compared Irvine to Psycho character, Norman Bates. He said: 'To me it feels just a little bit cheap and absurd. It's like Norman Bates dressing up in his mother's clothing, it feels a little creepy and I feel like you are going to stitch someone's skin to your face and then kill everybody in the audience.' Kills continued: 'It's absolutely disgusting... you make me sick. You have no identity... I am ashamed to be here.' Irvine appeared to take the abuse in his stride and said ‘I think I look really good’. Despite Moon having a look that resembles other more famous singers such as Mark Ronson, Olly Murs and Michael Bublé, Kills replied: ‘You look good because you're dressed as my husband.’ Both their comments were roundly booed by the audience. And fellow judge Melanie Blatt, the former All Saints singer, defended Irvine. She told him: ‘Actually, you're dressed better than her husband.’ Mark Weldon, chief executive of MediaWorks, which owns and operates TV3 - the channel that broadcasts the show - said on Monday afternoon the pair would no longer be welcome on the hit reality show. 'Last night on X Factor both Kills and Moon made comments that were completely unacceptable,' he said. 'While the judges on X Factor are expected to provide critiques of the performances, we will not tolerate such destructive tirades from any of the judges. 'Contestants put their all into this competition and they should expect to receive feedback and criticism that is professional and constructive. 'We no longer have confidence that Kills and Moon are the right people to perform the role of X Factor judges and they will leave the show, effective immediately.’ Two new judges are said to replace Moon and Kills next week, while Blatt and fellow judge Stan Walker will take over on Monday night. A Facebook group called 'Fire Natalia Kills from X Factor NZ' was created after the show, amassing over 57,500 followers, while a petition demanding the same thing gathered 74,000 signatures. Afterwards Blatt took to Twitter to slam Kills. She wrote: 'Ive tried to keep my cool and stay professional but really @nataliakills ? Sorry love , you're a t**t.' Kills and Moon had earlier caused controversy when they repeatedly called a mother from Auckland the C-word following an argument over a parking space, then refused to apologise. Water off a duck's back... Kills tweeted shortly after the show, seemingly unfazed by the petitions and Facebook groups calling for her to be fired . Not happy: People tweeted in their droves about their disgust at Kills and Moon's comments . Not happy: Fans aired their grievances about the insults that were hurled by the pair of judges . You're a t**t!' Fellow judge and former All Saints member Melanie Blatt attacked Kills on social media . Outraged: Blatt could no longer keep her cool and took to her own social media account to speak out about the televised humiliation . Replaced: Two new judges are said to replace Moon and Kills next week, while Blatt and fellow host Stan Walker will take over on Monday night . Tracey Neal-Gailer, 51, described how Moon used the abusive term last Tuesday after he reprimanded her for taking a bakery parking space he believed was his in the Auckland suburb of Kingsland.

4a7b3f319f2102bebff7657f669a905bf89aeb8c,"In the wake of Manchester City’s recent Barclays Premier League defeat by Liverpool, the first thing the club’s Brazilian midfielder Fernando did was seek out compatriot Philippe Coutinho. ‘I wanted to say ‘‘well done’’ to him after his winning goal,’ revealed Fernando. ‘To me, he is the best Brazilian playing in Europe at the moment.’ Elsewhere at Anfield, the criticism of the City midfield that had started after the home defeat by Barcelona four days earlier was being cranked up to the next level. Fernando admits he is finding life in the Premier League tough in his first season since moving from Porto . Fernando (right) and Fernandinho (left) attends a Disability Awareness Workshop with local kids on Thursday . Fernando says Liverpool's Philippe Coutinho, tracked by his mate Fernandinho, is the best current Europe-based Brazilian player . According to those on TV paid to know, City had lost back-to-back games simply because of failings in central midfield. Fernando played in the first game and not the second. Was he, therefore, at least partly culpable for setbacks that seem to have done so much to damage City’s aspirations at home and in the Champions League? Fernando: 'I haven’t reached my level here yet and the language is a problem' ‘It’s really hard,’ Fernando admitted on Thursday. ‘I haven’t reached my level here yet and the language is a problem. The Premier League is very challenging. ‘This season has gone OK, I think, but I’m hoping my next season will be a lot better. It was really difficult against Barcelona. We were not playing a normal team. ‘We want to get to that level but we need to learn if we are going to be successful in the Champions League. We know we can win in Barcelona. But having an attacking mentality won’t help us if we go over the top with that. Our mentality has to be right. ‘The criticism will always come if things aren’t going well. It can be aimed at the strikers or the defence and now at this time it is the midfield. It shouldn’t do but that is just what happens.’ City’s shot at European redemption comes next Wednesday at the Nou Camp. Manuel Pellegrini’s team trail 2-1 and need a huge result if they are going to become an isolated Premier League representative in the last eight. At home, City trail Chelsea in the Premier League by five points and have played a game more. On Tuesday, Fernando watched Jose Mourinho’s team exit Europe in a rather feisty game at Stamford Bridge. On a night more memorable for needle than football, it was tempting to wonder if Chelsea were beginning to show signs of frailty. The Brazilian midfielder has come under fire as part of the under-performing City midfield, but showed some skills playing sitting volleyball for school children in Manchester . Fernando, who says mentality will be the most important factor for City in their bid to turn around a 2-1 margin against Barcelona in the Champions League last-16, attempts to play football with a blindfold . Certainly Fernando revealed he could not imagine his City team-mates hounding a referee in similar fashion. He did, however, have an interesting take on why some footballers - including friends such as David Luiz, Oscar and Thiago Silva - behave the way they do. ‘It’s not something that would happen in our team,’ he told Sportsmail. ‘We are mainly a very calm team that concentrates on actually trying to win the game on the pitch. ‘We play according to whatever happens and we don’t try to change things by altering decisions and trying to influence the result that way. The 27-year-old is assisted by a girl during the appearance as part of City in the Community . ‘Every player has to hold things in. There are so many occasions when you actually want to say things but you must not. ‘At City I follow the example of people like James Milner, Joe Hart and Pablo Zabaleta. They are players who just try to play and not talk too much. ‘But you have to understand that the Champions League is a huge competition and the players were aware of that on Tuesday. ‘It was two great teams wanting to go through. ‘The players were aware of the investment each club had made so they had that pressure too. ‘The players were tense and that’s why these things happen. It’s adrenaline and tension.’ On Thursday at City’s training base, Fernando and his team-mate and fellow Brazilian Fernandinho took part in a Disability Awareness Workshop with local schoolchildren organised by the club’s City in the Community scheme. So close are the two that when Fernandinho was chosen for random doping after training, his friend waited for him before arriving to take part in the event. Fernando was also there at Anfield, of course, when Fernandinho and City captain Vincent Kompany had a rather frank exchange of views about what was going wrong. ‘In every team and every player there is a need to talk,’ he said. ‘It has to happen. It helps. We are working to improve when things are going wrong. It’s a quality and we will carry on with that. 'Fernandinho isn’t even a tiny bit upset about. It’s a story for a day and people like to talk but it means nothing to us.’ Back at home in Brazil, they are still coming to terms with their own bad news day. That came last July when the national team flunked a World Cup semi-final, losing 7-1 to Germany. Fernando watched that game in a Brazilian restaurant in Manchester and put his hands to his head at mention of it yesterday. Now 27, he has international aspirations of his own but knows he - and his country - have much to learn. Chelsea players remonstrate with referee Bjorn Kuipers as he sends of Zlatan Ibrahimovic . Fernando attempts to hold off Leicester's Esteban Cambiasso as he continues to find his feet in England . ‘It is really hard for Brazil now,’ he said. ‘We have had to learn a lesson from what happened. ‘The Germans and the Dutch have improved and we needed to realise that we have to catch up. ‘Tactically we have fallen behind. If I get called up then of course I will be extremely happy. I am focused on my performance here, though. ‘Every players needs time to get settled and get his status. This is what I am doing.’ Isaias paved the way for Brazilians in the Premier League on his signing with Coventry in 1995 . FIRST BRAZILIAN IN THE PREMIER LEAGUE (AND FIRST GOAL SCORER): . Isaias Marques Soares, aka Isaias, signed for Coventry from Benfica in the summer of 1995.

A Bitcoin is a piece of data locked in an internet-based network by a complex equation computers can break. Each Bitcoin is a piece of code that has been generated through computer processing, known as 'mining'. Once released it can be traded and used online and can be bought with cash. Bitcoin operates as a two-way currency which can be exchanged for dollars, and vice versa. The finite nature of Bitcoins means it performs more like a commodity, such as gold. Bitcoin first emerged in 2008 and launched as a network in 2009. It was created by a hacker whose identity is a mystery, but is known as Satoshi Nakamoto. This is thought to be a pseudonym for the person or group who created it. Users choose a virtual wallet  which enables them to receive, give and trade coins from other users. The app only works with fitness trackers that monitor heart rate and have open source software, which includes the Jawbone UP3 and Mio. As the wearer exercises, the fitness tracker sends the heart rate data and length of activity to the app which then determines how much energy is being used. An algorithm then converts this energy into 'computer processing time on a Bitcoin mining rig' - or how much computer power would be needed to mine the virtual coins.

Although this is a low amount, the technology is a concept so needs some refinement. Plus the more energy a user expends, the more money they make. As the wearer exercises, the tracker sends heart rate data and length of activity to the app which then determines how much energy is being used. An algorithm converts this energy into 'computer processing time on a Bitcoin mining rig' - or how much computer power would be needed to mine the virtual coins .

The current Queensland Reds player pleaded guilty to the downgraded charges, after he had originally been charged with supplying the illicit drug. The fine of $2500 is substantially less than the amount Hunt paid for the drugs, which have a street value of roughly $300 per gram. Later in the afternoon, the Australian Rugby Union came down much heavier on Hunt, hitting him with a six-week ban and $30,000 fine. He also stood down from his position of vice-captain at his club. Scroll down for video . Football star Karmichael Hunt was all smiles as he left court without a conviction, after he earlier pleaded guilty to cocaine possession. Hunt arrives in court prior to pleading guilty to four counts of cocaine possession. All four charges relate to a month-long period from September 1 to October 4 last year, when Hunt was on a 'regrettable' post-season bender, according to his lawyer, Alastair McDougall. Hunt accepted the blame for his actions and apologised to his team and to fans of the game. 'I made a terrible mistake last year and have no one but myself to blame for this situation,' Hunt said in a statement issued this afternoon. 'I am genuinely sorry for the distress I have caused my family, friends, team mates, Reds members, sponsors, fans and the wider rugby and sporting community in Queensland and beyond. Earlier in the day, Hunt said he was 'relieved' with the court's decision. 'I'm looking forward to putting his part of the process behind us and moving on,' he said. Hunt is scheduled to have an official press conference on Friday, but speaking outside of court he was 'relieved with the outcome'. Mr McDougall did not dispute the facts presented by police, and said they were the results of 'poor choices' by his client. 'He'll be paying for those choices for the rest of his life,' Mr McDougall said. 'He has suffered significant economic loss....it's an enormous economic loss. 'This has been a massive, massive wake-up call to him.' ARU boss Bill Pulver expressed his disappointment with Hunt, but said the sport will stand behind the embattled player. 'Illicit substances have no place in Rugby,' Mr Pulver said in a statement. 'However we acknowledge that he is sincerely remorseful and has cooperated with the investigation and our integrity enquiries throughout this process. Karmichael has also accepted the penalty and consequences of his actions and understands the requirements of a professional athlete and the expectations of our code.' The court heard Hunt liked buying '8-balls' or 'big ones' that contain 3.5g of cocaine, for $1100, from former NRL players.

But while the beautiful and headstrong leading lady Demelza won over millions of fans, one man was furious with the depiction: Poldark's original creator Winston Graham. The author was 'livid' with the way the BBC portrayed the impulsive servant from his series of historical novels as promiscuous, and wanted the show pulled from the screens. Anthony Robin Ellis as Captain Ross Poldark and Angharad Rees as Demelza in one of the biggest TV phenomena of the 1970s, Poldark . Demelza was memorably played by flame-haired Angharad Rees. Graham's daughter Rosamund Barteau made the revelation to The Mail on Sunday, as a much-anticipated remake starts tonight. 'Father blew a gasket when he saw the first episode of the original series,' she says. 'He was so angry about the way they had changed Demelza into a floozy that he wanted to get the production halted. 'He was absolutely livid. In the novel she was a spirited tomboy, but the producers had some salacious need to make her sexually loose. Poldark's original creator Winston Graham  was furious with the depiction of character Demelza, pictured is the author's wife Jean Graham . 'In one scene she even offered to pull down her knickers for a shilling. That certainly was not in the books. 'Father, fearing the other episodes would be more like a bad romance novel, tried everything he could to stop the show from airing. But he did not have any editorial control. 'It was not until the second series that he was able to have any input.' But Graham came to embrace the show, which was a runaway success on both sides of the Atlantic. Rosamund – who now lives in Idaho after marrying an American – cannot remember a time when Poldark was not a part of her life. 'As a child I knew it was important not to play too loudly, when dad was locked in his study,' she recalls. 'We lived in a lovely Cornish village and at those times I usually took myself off to my friend's house. 'Father woke up early, went into his study and wrote something every day. And every afternoon would have tea with my mother for an hour, when he would bounce ideas at her.' Remake: The new version casts heart-throb Aidan Turner in the lead role of Captain Ross Poldark, originally played by Robin Ellis . 'Father was the author, but she helped with some of the details because she was very observant. 'She saw everything and remembered it all. She had an eye for detail and could help my father with his writing. She had the most amazing sense of humour, too. Rosamund Barteau is keeping her father's creation alive – by running a Poldark-themed guesthouse in Idaho. The bedrooms, arranged around a central swimming pool, are named after the story's four main characters. 'Americans love themed vacations, and Poldark was a hit on US TV and sold well on video,' she says. 'It has a good following in the States.' 'I was in my late teens when I was old enough to read my father's novels. I am very pleased that they have stood the test of time and a new generation will be able to enjoy the series – and the books.' The new version casts heart-throb Aidan Turner in the lead role of Captain Ross Poldark, originally played by Robin Ellis. He returns from the American War of Independence to find his father dead, his house wrecked and his sweetheart engaged. His romance with Demelza, played by Eleanor Tomlinson, is again at the heart of the series. 'I've seen the first episode with Aidan and I could sit and watch it again and again,' says Rosamund. 'I think my dad would be very proud of what the BBC have done. Eleanor's Demelza is wonderful and her Cornish accent is good. It isn't too strong but enough to know where she is supposed to be from.'","Poldark's writer Winston Graham was 'livid' with BBC depiction of Demelza .

Adel Shirshab, the country's tourism and antiquities minister, said there are concerns the militants had removed artefacts and blown up the site, located nine miles north-east of Mosul. Saeed Mamuzini, a Kurdish official from Mosul, said militants had already begun demolishing the Khorsabad site on Sunday, citing multiple witnesses. On Friday, the group razed 3,000-year-old Nimrud and on Saturday, they bulldozed 2,000-year old Hatra - both Unesco world heritage sites. Scroll down for video . The foundations of an ancient palace in the Assyrian city of Khorsabad which has reportedly been looted and destroyed by Islamic State militants near the Iraqi city of Mosul . The sculptured stone slabs that once lined the palace walls at Khorsabad are now displayed in museums around the world including these Assyrian winged bulls now housed in the British Museum in London . Other statues of winged bulls from Khorsabad can be found in the Louvre museum in Paris . UN secretary general Ban Ki Moon has called the destruction a 'war crime'. A statement by his spokesman on Sunday night said Mr Ban was 'outraged by the continuing destruction of cultural heritage in Iraq' by ISIS. Khorsabad was constructed as a new capital of Assyria by King Sargon II shortly after he came to power in 721BC and abandoned after his death in 705BC. It features a city wall with a stone foundation and seven gates. Since it was a single-era capital, few objects linked to Sargon II himself were found. However, the site is renowned for shedding light on Assyrian art and architecture. The sculptured stone slabs that once lined the palace walls are now displayed in museums in Baghdad, Paris, London and Chicago. ISIS currently controls about a third of Iraq and Syria. Officials in the northern city of Mosul confirmed militants with the terror group have begun destroying the archaeological site of Hatra in northern Iraq. A file photo shows the temple to the Shamash sun god in Hatra . Iraq's minister of tourism and antiquities said the government was also investigating reports that the ancient archaeological site of Hatra in north west Iraq is being demolished by militants from the Islamic State group . The Sunni extremist group has been campaigning to purge ancient relics they say promote idolatry that violates their fundamentalist interpretation of Islamic law. Yesterday, officials officials  reported the jihadists have begun destroying the archaeological site of Hatra in northern Iraq. It comes after fanatics went on a rampage in the Assyrian city of Nimrud in northern Iraq, destroying the 3,000 year-old winged statues placed at the gates of the Palace of Ashurnasirpal. A video released last week also showed them smashing artefacts in the Mosul museum. In January, the group also burned hundreds of books from the Mosul library and Mosul University, including many rare manuscripts. At a press conference earlier yesterday, Mr Shirshab said they have called for an extraordinary session of the UN Security Council to address the crisis in Iraq. 'The world should bear the responsibility and put an end to the atrocities of the militants, otherwise I think the terrorist groups will continue with their violent acts,' he said.

Fatally injured: The unidentified South African, who appears to be in his teens, was seen with horrific burns covering most of his upper body. He is heard begging passers-by to take him to the hospital - but he is cruelly told to walk if he wants treatment. The man died the following day . The explosive blast was also seen by locals at the same time as the electricity cut out throughout the Witbank suburbs. As they rushed over to see what had happened they saw the man smoking and shouting for help as he climbed out of the Botha substation in the city's Lynnvill suburb. According to the local council's acting municipal manager Theo van Vuuren, the thief had probably been attempting to repeat the success of an earlier theft at the same substation. During that incident electrical wiring was stolen leaving the areas of Lynnville and Ackerville without electricity. 'Today a thief attempted to steal and vandalise Botha substation, only weeks ago this same substation was hit leaving Lynnville and Ackerville without electricity,' van Vuuren said. 'The team has managed to restore power to Lynnville and part of Ackerville. After restoring power a cable fault emerged and this is affecting part of Ackerville as well as Thushanang.' He did not comment on the video footage of the young thief that appeared a short while later showing people refusing to assist the man as he screamed in pain and shouted for help. One eyewitness, who asked not to be named, said: 'The man came out of nowhere and was screaming, obviously in a lot of pain. His whole body was burned, the skin was left hanging off his body and some of his hair also burnt off.' Several community members came out to see why he was shouting but no one wanted to help the poor man. They were all staring at him,' he added. Video of the incident captures locals shouting: 'What were you doing? You brought this on yourself, what were you doing in the substation?' 'I am burning, I am dying and it is so painful, please get an ambulance,' the horrifically injured thief shouted back. According to the source, the man walked 500 metres to the clinic where the nursing staff called an ambulance. He was taken to a nearby hospital but is understood to have died the next day. The local police spokesperson colonel Leonard Hlathi said that they had not had any reports about the theft and the dead man's identity remains unknown.","Young thief was horrifically burnt in the outskirts of the city of Witbank .

Almost 30 Year 10 pupils streamed out into the streets to watch the moon pass in front of the sun, only to be given immediate detentions. Orders: The school (pictured logo) gave detentions for the class of 30 children that skipped lessons after warning about looking at the eclipse with the naked eye . Last night, parents complained their children had been punished just for showing curiosity about the world around them. Clifford Stott, whose daughter was one of those given a detention, said: ‘It was the perfect platform for engaging the children with a whole range of educational issues – physics, mathematics and cosmology. 'To punish them does little more than alienate them. I feel outraged.’ The school insisted it had punished the children for disobeying warnings during assembly at the start of the day about the dangers of looking at the eclipse with the naked eye. Principal Jan Levenson said: ‘It was a question of safety. At the heart of this has been the protection of children from the harmful effects of viewing the eclipse without proper eye protection.’ During detention, she added, pupils were asked to ‘reflect on their misbehaviour, their truanting and the fact they put themselves at very serious risk’.

College student Lynne Schulze, 18, vanished in Middlebury, Vermont in 1971, at a time when Durst owned a health food store in town called All Good Things. She was last seen standing at a bus stop opposite the store. Middlebury police chief Tom Hanley said at a press conference on Tuesday that Durst's name was first connected with the missing girl in 2012, following a tip from a member of the public about him owning the store but who was unaware of his link to Schulze. Investigators searched Durst's former property in the area last year but found 'nothing of interest in this case', the chief told a press conference on Tuesday afternoon. Scroll down for video . College student Lynne Schulze, 18, vanished in Middlebury, Vermont in 1971, at a time when Durst owned a health food store in town called All Good Things. She was last seen at a bus stop opposite the store after buying prunes inside . Robert Durst and his first wife, Kathleen McCormack in an undated picture. The couple lived in Vermont in the early seventies around the time a teenage girl vanished from the area. Kathleen Durst later went missing in 1982. She has never been found . On the day she vanished, Miss Schulze, who was a freshman at Middlebury College, was seen at 12.30pm across the street from Durst's store at a bus stop, eating prunes she had bought inside. She was trying to catch a bus to New York City on December 10, the case's lead detective Kristine Bowdish said on Tuesday, but it had already left. The teen returned to her nearby college dorm room at 12.45pm and remained there for ten minutes. At 1pm, her final exam began but she did not attend. At 2.15pm she was seen once again at the bus stop across from the health food store. She has not been seen since. Miss Schulze was last seen wearing blue jeans, a maroon sweater, parka and boots. She was 5'2', around 105lb and had severe acne at the time. All her possessions including her ID were left at her college room. She was not reported missing until December 16 when her parents, who lived in Simsbury, Connecticut, contacted police. Fellow students had not noticed she was missing for several days in the ebb and flow of the end of term. Middlebury Police Detective Kristine Bowdish points to a photograph of the building where Robert Durst owned the All Good Things health food store in the 1970s. The store is near where Middlebury College student Lynne Schulze, was spotted December 10, 1971, the day she was last seen . Her parents had asked that their daughter's disappearance be kept quiet for several weeks. It was finally made public on January 24, 1972. Durst, who owned the Middlebury health store for two years and lived in the area with wife Kathleen, was not questioned in 1971, police said on Tuesday. The original investigator in the case has been dead for 20 years. Police admitted there was no indication that Miss Schulze and Durst had ever met or interacted. However Chief Hanley said that Durst was 'a person who had a proximate connection with the missing person' and that they were cooperating with other agencies, including the FBI, for an opportunity to talk with the 71-year-old real estate scion. 'When it involves Robert Durst, it's a broad scope we have to deal with on this,' Hanley said. He added that police had been 'following the news...and trying to get as many memories going as possible'. The student's disappearance was classed as an open missing person case and a possible homicide. Chief Hanley said there was 'assumed wrongdoing'. The Schulze case had been reopened in 1992 after police received several leads but they came to nothing. Robert Durst (pictured left in a court sketch this week and right, leaving a hearing last week) is wanted for questioning by police in Middlebury, Vermont after being connected to a missing girl . The missing college student was the latest suspicious case to be linked to Durst who has also been dogged by questions about his first wife's disappearance in New York . It was not until 2012 that a citizen called Middlebury police and told them Durst had owned the store. Durst, is currently awaiting extradition to California to face a murder . charge for the 2000 execution-style killing of his friend Susan Berman, was denied bail on Monday in New Orleans. Durst, who recently featured in the HBO documentary 'The Jinx', must remain in Louisiana on weapons charges until his next court date on April 2, a judge ruled, finding him a likely flight risk and a potential danger to others. Middlebury police said the 2012 tip about Durst did not come from the producers of the HBO show. Both of Lynne Schulze's parents had passed away without ever knowing what happened to their daughter. Her brothers and sisters were 'very interested in the Robert Durst lead', police said. The family has also asked for privacy. Chief Hanley said: 'I've got an 18-year-old woman who disappeared, who didn't deserve to disappear. 'We've kept this case alive for many years and will continue until we bring resolution to her family.' Durst was being looked at in connection with five deaths or disappearances. Two women disappeared in California, his first wife vanished in New York, another woman went missing in Texas and now the latest, a teen college student in Vermont. Durst's lawyer, Dick DeGuerin, did not seek bail but argued . his client's arrest and the search of his hotel room earlier . this month in New Orleans were improper, and that investigators . wrongly interviewed him without counsel present. Durst's attorneys want to expedite his extradition to Los . Angeles County, where he has been charged with the 2000 murder . of longtime friend Susan Berman and could face the death . penalty. The HBO documentary broadcast Durst being presented with . evidence his handwriting appeared to match that of Berman's . likely killer.

c49eafc214605c4fd905132b879b42954a584273,"Jeremy Clarkson, pictured, has been compared to Jimmy Savile by a senior BBC manager in advance of a probe into the latest Top Gear incident . The BBC launched an astonishing attack on Jeremy Clarkson yesterday, comparing him to sex offender Jimmy Savile and urging him to check into rehab. Blaming the now notorious ‘fracas’ with a Top Gear producer on ‘personal issues’, one of the most senior Corporation executives said Clarkson was ‘self-destructing’ and needed help. Most controversially, the TV chief, who has been directly involved in the fallout from the incident, likened Clarkson’s supporters – including the Prime Minister – to those who turned a blind eye to Savile’s appalling crimes. Last night, friends of the 54-year-old presenter expressed disbelief that the BBC should make such explosive claims before its internal investigation into the controversy has even begun. ‘I am in total shock that someone at the BBC would attack their own talent and deliberately smear Jeremy,’ said Perry McCarthy, who was Top Gear’s mysterious test driver The Stig. The broadside came as further details of the alleged assault on producer Oisin Tymon emerged. One report claimed Clarkson split Tymon’s lip with a punch, leaving him needing hospital treatment. Other sources told this newspaper that Clarkson had not been drinking – and that the row was not entirely about the lack of a hot meal at the end of a day’s filming. But the most astonishing development came during a wide-ranging official briefing given to The Mail on Sunday by a senior BBC figure. The executive likened 36-year-old Tymon’s position to that of Savile’s victims, who feared they would not be believed while he was alive. ‘The pressure this guy [Tymon] is under is so Savilesque in a way,’ he said, adding that Clarkson’s support from high-level politicians recalled the way Savile was once defended. ‘If you look at what David Cameron says or what [former Culture and Media Secretary] Maria Miller says and you swap Clarkson for Savile, you get this: David Cameron is effectively saying that Savile’s a real talent, Maria Miller saying Savile will be Savile.’ The comparison will inevitably anger Savile’s victims. Conservative MP Conor Burns, who sits on the Culture, Media and Sport Select Committee, said that ‘it is not just patently absurd, it’s also deeply offensive to Jeremy Clarkson and those innocent people who were horribly abused by Savile’. The BBC executive also said that attempts to suggest the ‘fracas’ was part of a wider battle between Clarkson and Danny Cohen, the BBC’s powerful director of television, were misleading. Clarkson is said to have a difficult relationship with Cohen, who told him that he was on a final warning after a string of controversies. ‘People keep saying that this is a case of Danny Cohen v Jeremy Clarkson. It is not,’ said the executive. ‘This is Jeremy Clarkson v Jeremy Clarkson… . ‘Jeremy is self-destructing. Danny is not the person who is driving this, it is Jeremy.’ Referring to the Top Gear host’s much-publicised split from his wife Frances after 21 years, the BBC chief added: ‘It is common knowledge he has personal issues; we have all read about them. ‘If I was advising him I would take one of two options. Do what he is doing now and continue to try to play it down – or I would go into rehab and show the world I am trying to change. ‘The BBC has stood by him before when he has been in hot water… But this is more serious.’ BBC Director of Television Danny Cohen, pictured, is said to have a difficult relationship with Jeremy Clarkson . The BBC producer involved in the 'fracas' with Jeremy Clarkson is privately terrified he is going to lose his job, sources claimed. Oisin Tymon has been working on the Top Gear franchise in various roles since 2005 and has also been an assistant producer on BBC One’s The One Show. But the 36-year-old has been in hiding all week, when it emerged he had been punched by the presenter. One insider close to his legal team at Slater and Gordon described Tymon as ‘mortified’. 'He is terrified that he might lose the job he loves and has been doing for the past six years. All he wants to do is to get back to work,' they told the Sunday Mirror. 'He is mortified by the whole thing.' BBC sources have claimed that Top Gear would survive without Clarkson as other shows – including Have I Got News For You and Strictly Come Dancing – have coped with the loss of a much-loved presenter. They added about Tymon: 'We would hope he will continue to be employed by the BBC after this matter is resolved.' Clarkson is being represented by law firm Olswang, which refused to comment. As the row intensified, sources in the Clarkson camp gave The Mail on Sunday what they say is the most definitive account yet of the events leading to the hotel incident. Contrary to what has been widely reported, they insisted the presenter had not been drinking beforehand – although co-presenter James May downed a bottle of white wine. Neither did Clarkson explode with anger at the hotel just because he couldn’t have an expensive steak. ‘Yes, it is true that there was no supper but he was angry because they didn’t have enough producers during the day and it made filming extremely difficult,’ said one source. Others close to the star – who has been suspended by the BBC – accurately predicted the Corporation would cast him as a man careering ‘off the rails’. Even so, the depth of the attack, and the personal nature of the comments, will surprise many – especially as, until now, the Corporation has been careful to limit its comments ahead of the inquiry. The executive’s comments drew a furious reaction from Clarkson supporters. Perry McCarthy added: ‘This will be a nightmare for Jeremy and he will feel deeply concerned that someone at the Corporation has spoken his name in the same sentence as that disgusting creature Jimmy Savile. ‘It is ill-conceived, as was the decision to suspend him and take Top Gear off the air. Jeremy is a brilliant broadcaster and a fantastic guy. ‘It’s atrocious that these idiots at the BBC are paid so much money but run it about as well as a three-year-old child.’ Clarkson is accused of punching TV producer Oisin Tymon, pictured, after a day's filming in Yorkshire . Clarkson, May and Richard Hammond had been filming in Surrey all day before the incident. They left at just after 6pm for a two-and-half-hour helicopter flight to the luxury Simonstone Hall hotel in the Yorkshire Dales. On board, May drank a bottle of wine, but Clarkson drank nothing as he had to work on a script later that evening. A senior BBC source has reportedly told people that Clarkson's much publicised split from his wife Frances, left, could be behind his melt-down . Filming had been fraught because of the shortage of producers and Clarkson was tired, annoyed and hungry, having had nothing to eat all day, the sources say. And it was against this background, that they arrived at the hotel to be told there was no hot supper. What happened next will have to be established by the BBC’s inquiry. It is not thought that Clarkson will dispute ranting at Tymon. But he is already said to deny calling him a ‘lazy Irish ****’. One account will claim the presenter went nose-to-nose with Tymon and said: ‘You’ll be on the dole tomorrow. ‘I’m going to make sure you will not have a job.’ The executive who briefed The Mail on Sunday said: ‘ [Tymon] could be in hospital because of this. ‘He is watching it all play out. Jeremy is a bit more used to it. I don’t think Jeremy has got the most to lose. ‘He has got the money to see him out through his days if he needs to. The other guy [Tymon] is just a jobbing producer.’ Insiders say the BBC – which holds the rights to the lucrative Top Gear format – is prepared to continue making the show even if it means getting a new presenter or presenters. They say other shows, such as Have I Got News For You, survived the departure of a host and there was no reason Top Gear could not do the same. Sources said the BBC remained the best place for a fearless motoring programme, because it was not beholden to advertisers. Yesterday Clarkson looked downcast as he left his West London apartment. He declined to comment but told journalists: ‘You must be freezing.’ The BBC claims that Top Gear will survive if Jeremy Clarkson, pictured, is no longer involved in the show . The BBC disciplinary panel will be led by Ken MacQuarrie, the head of BBC Scotland, who carried out the investigation into Newsnight’s false exposé of Lord McAlpine. Clarkson started the disciplinary process himself when he told his bosses at the BBC about the row. Meanwhile, a petition to reinstate Clarkson has gathered more than 920,000 signatures. The Prime Minister appeared to lend his support when he described Clarkson as a ‘friend’ and ‘huge talent’, adding that he hoped the situation could be resolved so his children would not be left ‘heartbroken’. Clarkson is scheduled to appear alongside May and Hammond at four live shows in Norway later this month. All three presenters’ contracts expire three days after the Norway gigs. The last three episodes of the series have been put on hold. Tonight’s show has been replaced with a documentary about the Red Arrows.","A senior BBC TV executive has launched an attack on Jeremy Clarkson .

0fe70fda0a5d2b348605e6c5fc64c5907e84da08,"Mexican cockfighting promoters on Friday kicked off an event billed as the largest exhibition of the bloodsport the country has ever seen. The annual Texcoco Horse Fair, which takes places on the eastern fringes of Mexico City, will see 16 nightly bouts of cockfighting over the space of a month – all of which end in the death of one of the animals. Trainers from all over the country compete not only for the title of best trainer, but also to keep alive what they claim is a proud Mexican tradition despite demands to ban the 'disgusting' sport. Scroll down for video . Injured birds are given only 15 seconds to recover, even if they are incapable of fighting back, in the brutal cockfights staged nightly during the month-long Texcoco Horse Fair . Razorblades are attached to the birds' left leg to make the fights 'more interesting' for gamblers and trainers . Trainers often spit on a rooster's head in a common technique used to anger the bird before it fights . Trainers from all over the country compete not only for the title of best trainer, but also to keep alive what they claim is a proud Mexican tradition - even though the 'sport' has been met with furious protests . 'Cockfighting is deeply embedded in Mexico's rural culture', Texcoco tourism spokeswoman Rosalinda Benitez told MailOnline on the opening night of the month-long bloodsport bonanza. 'We want to showcase the proud tradition to our visitors'. The event, which includes fairground attractions and one of Mexico's biggest horse auctions, expects to receive more than 600,000 visitors over the month. 'Banning these events will never be accepted by the public', said Jaime Rodriguez, a Texcoco resident who looks forward to the annual fair every year. 'This year they want to make clear how much the people love to come and watch quality cockfights'. While cockfighting is banned in all 50 US states and Europe (it was banned in England in 1835), it nevertheless draws big crowds in Mexico, where fans come to gamble on the fights and drink until the early hours of the morning. Male birds are vicious and often emerge from the scuffles with their beaks filled with other's feathers . 'We train our animals to attack with their legs and feet first, and use the beak to finish the job later' The dominant bird at this stage of the fight has ripped away some feathers from his stricken opponent . Starting on the edge of the arena, the gamecocks are shown to one another, producing aggressive crowing, before being placed in their respective corners and let loose to attack one another . A cock struts proudly in the ring, though it will only take one blow from a razor blade to strike him down . The gamecocks are displayed to the gamblers by being paraded around the circular arena before the fights . Cockfighting is also banned within the limits of Mexico City, four cities in the state of Veracruz and Coahuila state on the Texas border, but the bloodsport is nevertheless extremely popular in more rural areas of the country. Indeed the cockfighting arenas, known as palenques, are often the social hubs of many Mexican towns. 'Cockfighting is a family business', said Gregory Castillo, a gamecock trainer from Ranchito Gaby, one of the eight gamecock-producing ranches competing on the fair's opening night. 'We get a good reception wherever we perform and people always come out to witness the spectacle. It always produces a good party atmosphere'. Gregory had already seen two of his prize gamecocks die against superior opponents that evening, and was engaged in strapping the curved razorblade of Mexican cockfighting regulation onto the left leg of his third bird. 'The razorblades make for more interesting fights', he told the MailOnline as he spat on the rooster's head, a common technique to anger the bird before it enters the battle. 'We train our animals to attack with their legs and feet first, and use the beak to finish the job later'. The cuurved weapons attached to the birds' legs must be changed every five minutes in order to ensure they are not left blunted by the sand of the arena . Spatters of blood cover the floor of the cockfighting ring, surrounded by fans enjoying drinks and snacks . The cocks often scrap furiously on the floor of the arena, which is covered in blood from previous fights . 'Banning these events will never be accepted by the public', according to Jaime Rodriguez, a Texcoco resident who looks forward to the annual fair every year . The cockfighting areana, known as a palenque, in Texcoco has a capacity of more than 3,000 people, and few seats were left unsold as the public clamoured to see the opening event of the month-long celebration . The weapons attached to the birds' legs must be changed every five minutes in order to ensure they are not left blunted by the sand of the arena. 'It's a disgusting practice and there's no reason that it should continue simply because it's seen as tradition', said Leonora Esquivel, a leader of the AnimaNaturalis animal rights organisation, in a telephone interview with the MailOnline. Leonora's organisation, which works closely with Mexico's  Ecologist Green Party, is currently petitioning the government to put an end to animal cruelty in the country. The group focuses particularly on bullfights, cockfighting and illegal dogfights which occur periodically around the capital. Each cockfight runs for a maximum of 15 minutes, though most are over within two. Starting on the edge of the arena, the gamecocks are shown to one another, producing aggressive crowing, before being placed in their respective corners and let loose to attack one another. The flurry of feathers, beaks and claws is rapid and furious. The male birds are extremely vicious and often emerge from the scuffles with their beaks filled with other's feathers. Even if a bird is injured and not attempting to fight any longer, it is permitted only a 15 second recovery period before being placed within a yard of its opponent and forced to continue. The flurry of feathers, beaks and claws, when it comes, is rapid and furious and fights are always to-the-death . The sport revolves entirely around gambling, and betting odds are always 2:1 on the fight's outcome . 'Sometimes it comes down to luck. A weak bird might land a fatal blow with the razor and it's all over' A fight is declared over only when one of the birds is lying dead on the arena floor. The sport revolves entirely around gambling, and betting odds are always 2:1 on the fight's outcome. The gamecocks are displayed to the gamblers by being paraded around the circular arena, before being placed in front of a non-competitor mona ('monkey') gamecock to allow the gamblers to gauge their reactions. 'The more aggressively they peck, scratch and display their neck feathers at the mona, the more likely it is that they will be a good fighter', said Mauricio Alvarez, an observer in the crowd who had quadrupled his money over the previous two fights. 'But sometimes it comes completely down to luck. A weak bird might land a fatal blow with the razor and it's all over'. Bookmakers patrol the circular arena taking bets whenever a fight is not in progress. The high-rollers are always invited to seats within five rows of the arena and bookies' fees are negotiated depending on the size of the bets. The month-long Texcoco Horse Fair also features bullfighting and attracts more than 600,000 visitors a year . The facade of the main cathedral building in Texcoco (left). Mexico's national sport, charreria, is a kind of rodeo made up of different equestrian competitions and is also practiced at the fair (right) Cockfighting is banned within the limits of Mexico City, four cities in the state of Veracruz and Coahuila state on the Texas border, but is permitted in Texcoco, on the outskirts of the capital . For people further back in the stands, tennis balls with slits in them are thrown back and forth between gamblers and bookmakers: stuffed with stakes, winnings and losses. The palenque in Texcoco has a capacity of more than 3,000 people, and few seats were left unsold as the public clamoured to see the opening event of the month-long celebration. Following 16 cockfights, each ending with the bloodied loser unceremoniously dumped in a cement bucket, one of Mexico's most famous bands 'Los Angeles Azules' (The Blue Angels) took the animals' place to play to a packed house. The fair will culminate with three shows by Luis Miguel, one of Latin America's most famous artists and a Michael Bublé-esque crooner, from April 9 to 11. All the shows will follow directly on from the cockfights. In December of last year animal rights activists achieved a nationwide ban on the use of wild animals in circuses, imposing fines of up to £180,000 on organisations which cannot prove the domestic origins of any animals which are used in their performances. The Mexican government is currently engaged in the struggle to find homes for more than 2,000 repossessed tigers, lions, elephants and other such animals which have been freed as a result of the law. International supermarket chain WalMart was in trouble late last year as shoppers complained that a store in Veracruz state hosted a cockfight in order to promote a soft drinks company.","Annual Texcoco Horse Fair takes places on eastern fringes of Mexico City .

According to NHS, the symptoms of dehydration include 'dizziness or light-headedness, headache, tiredness, dry mouth, lips and eyes, and the passing of small amounts of urine infrequently.' Dehydration can also lead to a loss of strength and stamina and dry sinuses, nostrils and throat that make you far more prone to infection. Combat all of this by drinking plenty of water and keeping away from beverages with diuretic properties, like alcohol or coffee. Low humidity in cabin air means that passengers should keep diuretic beverages, like alcohol, to a minimum . Ear pain . Ever wondered exactly why you feel pain in your ears during takeoff and landing? It turns out that the uncomfortable feeling a product of the air on your ears expanding and causing increased pressure to build up within the ear canal. But it's only when this pressure cannot be released, such as due to blockage from a cold, for example, that the passenger will really be made aware of the change. Luckily, alleviating the pressure in most cases is relatively easy - simply by swallowing, chewing or yawning. Additionally, the motion sickness that you may feel in the pit of your stomach actually also starts in your inner ears, when your balance is thrown off by something like turbulence. Ear pain during take off and landing is due to the air on your ears expanding and causing increased pressure . In this instance, the best bet for preventing nausea is to book a seat over the wings, which is the steadiest part of the plane. And the final ear-related concern to contend with on board has to do with hearing. Whether watching a movie or listening to your iPod, the sounds you're blasting to block out engine noise and passenger chatter are probably wreaking a bit of havoc, since it's a different listening environment than you're used to with different levels of ambient noise to tune out. Although your hearing won't suffer any permanent damage after a plane ride or two, frequent fliers should take note of the decibel difference to avoid any sort of long-term effects. Lower levels of oxygen in the plane's pressurised air can cause light-headedness and shallow breathing . Oxygen deprivation . It may be a small difference, but the lower oxygen levels in the plane's pressurised air can lead to minor oxygen deprivation in travellers. This could cause light-headedness, shallow breathing or difficulty concentrating. If this happens to you, be sure to alert a flight attendant, as he or she may be able to provide you with additional oxygen or even increase the overall airflow to the plane. The lower pressure in the cabin can also affect your blood circulation, which could lead to swelling in your lower extremities - especially on long haul flights when you're cramped in your seat. Ideally, walk around the aircraft every 30 minutes, or, at the very least, flex and stretch your feet regularly. Deep vein thrombosis (DVT) occurs when blood clots develop in the legs due to long periods of inactivity . DVT . Deep vein thrombosis (or DVT) occurs when blood clots develop within the deep veins of the legs, causing pain and swelling. Occasionally, it may lead to complications such as pulmonary embolism, which is when a piece of blood clot breaks off into the bloodstream and blocks one of the blood vessels in the lungs. Anyone sitting for more than four hours, as most people do during long-haul flights, is at risk of developing DVT, however, certain groups may be at greater risk. Virgin Atlantic encourages anyone aged 40 or over, anyone with a family history of blood clothes or anyone being treated for cancer, heart failure or circulation problems to be especially cautious. To help prevent clots, moving around during the flight and wearing support stockings will both help to keep blood circulating. However, if you begin to feel short of breath, experience chest pain, or if your legs are still swollen after the flight, you should seek medical attention immediately. On long-haul flights, your exposure to radiation from cosmic rays, energetic particles from space, is higher . Radiation exposure . While on international flights, you're exposed to more than a tiny amount of radiation from cosmic rays, which are energetic particles from space, mostly made up of protons. The longer the flight and the higher and closer the plane flies to the North Pole, the greater the dose of radiation that crew and passengers alike will experience. While it's of most concern for those who fly for a living, frequent flier passengers will experience more of this exposure than people who spend more time on the ground. Several studies have found also that cancer rates among flight personnel are marginally higher than the rest of the general population, although a recent Center for Disease Control (CDC) report did not find further support of such a claim. However, the CDC does admit that experts are still not sure of the health risks associated with cosmic radiation and because you cannot see or feel it, often people do not just precisely when they are being exposed. Flying roundtrip from New York to Los Angeles, for example, three times per year, would expose passengers to the equivalent of 3 chest X-rays, or about 100 microSieverts. On a roundtrip flight from New York to Beijing, however, you can easily exceed that amount. Sun damage from UV rays . It is not something passengers would necessarily think to do before a flight, but applying suncream could well protect against UV damage in the skies. 'At high altitude, over 54 per cent of UVA rays penetrate glass, making pilots spending long periods in the cockpit up to twice as likely to develop melanoma,' Abi Cleeve, MD at UltraSun UK tells MailOnline Travel. 'In fact, 56.6 minutes in the air is equivalent to 20 minutes on a tanning bed.' When flying, a passenger is 100 times more at risk to catch a common cold than when not on a plane . Common cold . Finally, and what may seem insignificant in comparison to the other risks that befall frequent travellers, those who travel often may be at a greater risk for catching a common cold. A 2004 study in the Journal of Environmental Health Research found that when you're flying, your risk for catching a cold is over 100 times higher than when you're not on a plane. Take proper precautions and be sure to wash your hands frequently, and carry anti-bacterial hand sanitiser, when globe trotting. After all, the last thing you want is for a simple cold to slow you down on your next glamorous getaway.","When it comes to flying, there are plenty of health concerns to look out for .
Due to the lack of cabin air humidity, dehydration and swelling are common .
Cosmic radiation is also higher when in flight and closer to the North Pole ."

Less than two years ago, Dennis weighed in at a whopping 56 pounds — about the size of four or five miniature dachshunds. A series of 'before' photos show Dennis resting on rolls of fat, his head seemingly too little for his blob of a body. He couldn't take more than a few steps without being out of breath. Scroll down for video . In this June 2013 photo, Dennis, a dachshund, rests on the ground in Columbus, Ohio. Less than two years ago, Dennis weighed in at 56 pounds and could walk only a few feet without stopping, out of breath. But then Burton rescued him from his previous owner and provided him with a proper diet, exercise and affection . pictured on February 25, Dennis now only weighs 12 pounds and can freely play in the snow. He has had three skin-removal surgeries to remove the folds of excess skin . Then Brooke Burton adopted him from a relative who had fed him White Castle burgers, pizza and other human food, and didn't pay much attention to the dog's burgeoning belly. Burton, a 26-year-old nursing student, recalls how emotional she became when she first saw Dennis in June 2013, and then persuaded her relative to give him up. 'Out comes Dennis, and I couldn't believe it,' Burton says. 'I wasn't even sure what breed of dog he was supposed to be because he was so large.' Burton put him on diet of dry dog food, plus lots of walks and affection. Now the 6-year-old wiener dog is a svelte 12 pounds and happily chasing squirrels in the backyard, playing fetch and bossing around the other three rescue dogs that live with him. 'In the beginning, you could tell he was very depressed, that he really didn't feel good at all,' Burton says. 'He didn't have much of a personality. After he lost weight, this bossy little demanding man popped out. He's into everything, he wants to play with everybody.' Dennis lost so much weight that he started tripping over the folds of excess skin that were left over and getting infections. He has had three surgeries at the Ohio State University Veterinary Medical Center to get rid of it. The operations cost more than  $2,800 together and were covered by a GoFundMe page set up by Burton, donations from individuals and the OSU Veterinary Medical Center, according to  the Columbus Dispatch. Dr. Kathleen Ham, the veterinary surgeon who performed the operations, says Dennis' story is a good lesson for pet owners who might feed their animals too much. 'We have an expression: Food is not love,' Ham says. 'Most of what your pet wants from you is affection and attention.'","Dennis the miniature dachshund lost  75 percent of his body weight .

742163e2d890b106ef93dcee1354deea845db7f4,"(CNN)British actress Emma Watson made an impassioned plea to women around the world: ""Don't let anyone tell you what you can or cannot do, or cannot achieve. ""Just don't allow it. It's wrong. It's so wrong. Be what you want to be -- and prove them wrong."" The emotional Harry Potter star took to the stage at Facebook's headquarters in London on Sunday, March 8, to talk about gender equality as part of International Women's Day celebrations. CNN was among the live audience of around 150 people -- with millions more watching the live stream across the world --as the 24-year-old UN Goodwill Ambassador spoke about her own feminist journey. Emma's Facebook moment . Of the dozens gathered at the event, the majority were bespectacled young men -- not so unlike Harry Potter himself. Describing the ""surreal"" moment she gave a speech at U.N. headquarters, later watched by 17 million, Watson said:  ""Gender equality historically has been a woman's movement. ""And how it's affecting men hasn't been addressed,"" she told moderator Greg James. During the hour-long conversation, Watson gave the audience a  rare glimpse into her private life -- and the difference between chivalry and sexism. ""I love having the door opened for me, isn't that just polite?"" she said. ""But I think the key is, would you then mind me opening the door for you?"" ""Chivalry should be consensual."" And it's not just women affected by gender inequality -- men suffer too, she added. ""I get disturbed by this idea that men can't cry,"" she continued. ""They can't express themselves and I think that's the saddest thing in the world. Being able to express yourself is what makes you human -- it's not what makes you a girl."" When internet trolls threatened to release naked photos of the actress, following her UN speech, she said it only made her more determined in her campaign. ""If they were trying to put me off -- they did the opposite,"" she added. Almost 230,000 men and boys across the world have since joined the HeForShe campaign, including U.S. President Barack Obama, and actors Joseph Gordon-Levitt and Matt Damon. ""I read a letter of support from a 13-year-old boy that was equally as passionate as a CEO,"" said Watson, adding that she often read their stories before going to bed at night. ""I asked my younger sister: 'What would be the one thing you'd want from boys in your life?' She said: 'I just want them to play with us.' And I think that really translates at every level. We just want to be included."" Watson also talked about the inspiring influence of her mother, Jacqueline, who was a ""single working mother and type one diabetic."" ""She wanted me to be my own person and said a bit of rebellion was good,"" said Watson, adding: ""She was actually thrilled when I got my first detention... I think I failed a Latin exam."" Answering questions submitted via Facebook, Watson said the recent lack of female representation at the Academy Awards showed that the fight for gender equality was far from over. ""Why are women not directing their own stories?"" she said. ""The human race is a bird -- and it needs both its wings to fly. And at the moment one of its wings is clipped,"" said Watson, paraphrasing famous American feminist, Gloria Steinem. When asked what things we can all do to affect change, the actress said it wasn't necessarily about grand actions -- but small ones. ""It's everyday, it's individual, it's on a case by case basis,"" she said. ""Whether it's speaking up or trying to change the way someone else thinks about an issue."" In the audience, a man wearing a Hogwarts jumper asked Watson whether women should be paid the same as men, when they are more likely to take maternity leave. She answered: ""I don't think in the grand scheme of things [maternity leave] is going to hinder a woman being incredibly effective in her field.

7f66b15837d7ff3331d15386a5ed4b97fcea908b,"The father of murdered bride Anni Dewani has today marked what would have been his daughter's 33rd birthday in a hospital bed after his arm was torn off in a freak accident. Engineer Vinod Hindocha, 65, was fixing a lift when it plunged to the ground, ripping his right arm off. He underwent a 13-hour operation to reattach his limb after being airlifted to hospital in Gothenberg, Sweden. Today, Mr Hindocha posted a picture on Facebook of himself with two nurses and wife his Nilam, a cake and treats to mark Anni's birthday. She was 27 when she was shot dead on her honeymoon in South Africa. 'Celebrations': Vinod Hindocha marked his murdered daughter's 33rd birthday in a hospital bed after his arm was torn off in a freak accident. He posted this picture with two nurses and his wife Nilam (left) on Facebook . He wrote: ‘Happy Birthday little Angel. Miss U for ever. We R celebrating this Birthday In Gothinburg  hospital,love U for EVER’ Mr Hindocha was carrying out repairs on March 3 in Sweden when a chain slipped, sending the lift cage he was standing in hurtling to the ground floor. However, his arm was extended outside the cage at the time, meaning it was ripped off just below the shoulder. Mr Hindocha recalls seeing the limb suspended one storey above him after he fell. His brother Ashok, 54, told MailOnline that Mr Hindocha had recovered some movement in his fingers, but will not make a full recovery for at least 18 months, if ever. Vinod Hindocha, 65, was standing in a lift with his arm extending out of the cage when a chain slipped, dropping him to the ground floor . He added: 'He’s such a good person, he’s been through so much. Bad things happen to good people sometimes. 'Nilam and Vinod have had a very difficult few months. 'They are such a strong couple, they will get through this aswell. But it is a lot for anyone to go through. 'We are grateful that he was in Sweden and could get to hospital so quickly and into surgery to try and save the arm. Only time will tell whether the operation will be successful. 'Today is Anni's birthday and that fills the minds and hearts of all the family.' Mr Hindocha's wife Nilam, 64, who is in remission from stomach cancer, was with him in Sweden at the time of the accident and had gone shopping when he was hurt. The horrific accident comes after a harrowing court case attended by Mr Hindocha in which details of his daughter's murder were recounted in detail. Anni was killed on November 13 2010 while riding in a cab with her new husband, Shrien Dewani, 35, through the impoverished township of Gugulethu, Cape Town. The cab was hijacked by two gunmen who threw Shrien out before driving away. The vehicle was discovered the next day with Anni's body in the back seat. She had been shot in the neck. Shortly afterwards taxi driver Zola Tongo, 35, was arrested. He confessed to his part in the death, naming Xolile Mngeni and Mziwamadoda Qwabe as the men who carried out the fatal attack. Mr Hindocha (centre) told family members he saw his severed limb one storey above him after falling. Surgeons reattached the limb, but it will be 18 months before they know whether he will get movement back . The tragedy came after Mr Hindocha saw Shrien Dewani, the husband of his murdered daughter Anni, acquitted of ordering her killing (pictured, Shrien and Anni together before they wed) However, he also said Shrien had ordered him to carry out a hit on his new bride, claiming he wanted out of the marriage. After years of delays and legal wrangling during which Shrien claimed to be suffering from depression, he was finally extradited to South Africa to stand trial last year. During the short case, the judge heard that Shrien had been bisexual and had visited gay porn websites and chat rooms exploring his homosexual fantasies. The trial also heard testimony from several key witnesses, though one of the men serving time in jail for killing Anni, Xolile Mngeni, died of a brain tumour before he could give evidence. Eventually the judge threw the case out, telling prosecutors their argument was riddled with contradictions. Anni's family said they had been failed by the justice system and condemned the acquittal.

e866e771f1f0c8d7ee2b271cfce62e6d6a7aafa2,"(CNN)Team Cookie or Team Boo Boo Kitty? If you're a fan of the hit TV show ""Empire,"" you will totally get that reference to one of the main rivalries on the series. If you aren't a fan, you may soon be in the minority. The show has become something of an industry phenomenon, with ratings growing every week. According to Variety, two weeks before the season finale, which is set to air on March 18, ratings were up 53% from its January 7 premiere in the coveted 18-49 demo and total viewership had risen 45%, from 9.9 million to 14.3 million. Eight straight weeks of growth is almost unheard-of these days in broadcast TV, which has faced fierce competition from cable and streaming services. But Fox's ""Empire"" is doing the damn thing. The show revolves around the character of record label owner Lucious Lyon (played by Terence Howard) and his family, which includes three sons vying to take over his company and an ex-wife who took the fall for him and returns from prison intent on getting what's hers. ""You're so beautiful,"" Empire, and here are some of the reasons why: . Taraji P. Henson . Henson has been in the industry for a minute, and despite critically acclaimed roles in films like ""Hustle & Flow"" and ""The Curious Case of Benjamin Button"" (the latter of which earned her a best supporting actress Oscar nomination), her career hadn't really taken off. Not so now. Henson has sunk her teeth into the role of Lyon family matriarch Cookie. The character is hard-core and street smart and loves her family fiercely, even as she is also motivated by making money. The show's co-creator, Danny Strong, told Entertainment Weekly that fans can thank Henson for the now infamous ""Boo Boo Kitty"" nickname that viewers have come to love. When Cookie sneeringly calls her ex-husband Lucious' new lady love, Anika Calhoun (played by Grace Gealey), ""Boo Boo Kitty,"" you want to yell at the screen, ""Get her, Cookie!"" ""So, basically Taraji is a genius,"" Strong said. ""She's a comic genius, but she's also an incredibly powerful dramatic actress, and we're utilizing all that in Cookie."" Watch for Henson to snag nominations next award season. It's old school soapy . Think ""Dynasty"" and ""Dallas"" for the 21st century. It has all the things that make prime-time soaps so delicious: sex, scores to settle, family tensions, violence and did we mention sex? Set in the world of the music industry, there is plenty of glitz and glamor that is balanced with some seedy, dark underworld shenanigans to keep the plot moving at a pace that has viewers eagerly awaiting the next episode. That's a feat given how so many audiences have gotten used to being able to binge watch to scratch that ""and then what?"" itch. It's new-school hip . ""Empire"" has fully embraced everything that makes a modern drama modern. One of the primary story lines has been about homophobia, as Lucious Lyon and his son Jamal (Jussie Smollett) battle over Jamal revealing he's gay. It comes amid tons of conversation in this country about gay rights. Series co-creator Lee Daniels, himself an openly gay man, has said he wants to expose the problem of homophobia in the black community. ""Homophobia is rampant in the African-American community, and men are on the DL (down low, meaning living a double life and sleeping with both men and women). They don't come out, because your priest says, your pastor says, mama says, your next-door neighbor says, your homie says, your brother says, your boss says (that homosexuality is wrong),"" The Wrap reported Daniels saying during the Television Critics Association press tour in January. ""And they are killing African-American women. They are killing our women. So I wanted to blow the lid off more on homophobia in my community."" The music is off the hook . The show has managed to improve on what ""Glee"" did and succeed at what the now-canceled NBC drama ""Smash"" tried to do: fully incorporate music into the show and cross over to the actual music industry. Smollett has been the breakout star in this area. His mellow voice has carried some of the soundtrack's more popular tunes, including the anthem to individuality, ""Good Enough,"" which has more than 1 million listens on the streaming music service Spotify. Superproducer Timbaland (best known for work with artists including Jay Z and Justin Timberlake) and his protegee Jim Beanz are responsible for the show's sound. Beanz told Rolling Stone the music has to be authentic and original. ""One of the things that Tim told me is, 'If it sounds like something you've heard before, don't do it,' "" he said. Of course the show has cashed in on the songs by making them available on iTunes. Fingers crossed for a possible ""Empire"" tour featuring Smollett and other co-stars including Bryshere Y. Gray, who portrays youngest Lyon son Hakeem and who in real life raps under the moniker Yazz the Greatest. The awesome guest appearances . You could have knocked us over with a feather when Courtney Love popped up on the show. Love had a bit role on this first season, as has supermodel Naomi Campbell and '80s actor Judd Nelson. The series has been hyping appearances from music stars like Jennifer Hudson, Mary J. Blige and Patti LaBelle. Given the popularity of the show, there's no telling who will pop up on season 2. Henson and Howard . The love/hate relationship between Cookie and Lucious Lyon is everything. They have heat and many fans are rooting for the fictitious couple to reunite. Chalk it up to the longtime friendship between Henson and Howard, who also co-starred in the film ""Hustle and Flow."" Howard told BlackTree TV that he and Henson had to do a ""chemistry read"" to show that they clicked. The end result has been magical. ""We have so much fun,"" Howard said.","""Empire"" has seen its ratings grow every week .
Taraji P. Henson's character is a favorite .
The music is a big part of the show ."

Jennifer Muhm (left) and Malorie Catchpole (right) said they came up with the idea of buddingSTEM after experiences they had with their own daughters . 'We're not anti-princess. We're not anti-pink. We're not anti-girly. We just think there needs to be more than just that offered for our girls,' Muhm, 37, of Shoreline, Washington, told ABC News. She said her now-five-year-old daughter wanted to be an astronaut for Halloween in 2013, but noticed the costume catalog only had boys wearing the costume. 'She looked at me and said, 'I can't be an astronaut. They're only for boys',' Muhm told ABC. After seeing pictures of Sally Ride, Joan Higginbotham and other female astronauts, however, her daughter still dressed up as an astronaut, according to the moms' Kickstarter page. Muhm said her daughter wanted to be an astronaut for Halloween, but was put off by the fact that only boys wore the costume in the catalogs . Muhm and Catchpole said that their daughters are interested in things that are not usually found on girls' clothing, including space ships, dinosaurs and trains . Muhm told Catchpole, 34, also of Shoreline, about the issue and they were both frustrated. Catchpole told ABC that her three-year-old daughter is 'very into trains' and when she and her husband wanted to buy train-themed underwear as a gift to their daughter for Christmas, they could only find boy's underwear. Catchpole bought them anyway. 'I was actually at their house on Christmas and saw the boys' underpants under the tree, and it was that moment that it kind of clicked,' Muhm said. 'I said, 'You know what, Malorie? We should make underpants with trains on them… and then we thought why just underpants: There are no dinosaurs or rocket ships on leggings or dresses for girls',' she added. The women, who have no experience in the business of fashion created dresses, leggings, T-shirts and underwear  for girls between 18 months and eight years old . BuddingSTEM - STEM standing for science, technology, engineering and math - was registered as a business in April 2014. Since the business's origination, the moms have raised more than $52,500 for the company through a Kickstarter . And so the pair filed their business registration for buddingSTEM in April 2014. 'If there is something that is not fair - because my daughter will say that it is not fair - you can actually start working toward doing something about it,' said Muhm. With help from a textile designer and a Kickstarter that helped them raise $52,500 to date, the clothing line will be available in July. 'One of the things that I'm happiest about… is what I think we've shown our daughters,' Catchpole said. 'We're two working moms. We don't have a background in fashion, and we saw a need and we worked hard.' The clothing line features simply designed outfits that are easily mixed-and-matched with train, space and dinosaur themes. Clothing can come in blue and pink or teal and gray .

When a photograph of Labour leader Ed Miliband was displayed, the most popular response was 'weak' followed by 'idiot', 'Labour', 'useless' and 'untrustworthy' Like Mr Miliband, the overwhelming response to Mr Clegg was 'weak'. The Lib Dem leader has seen his party's popularity collapse since entering coalition five years ago, in large part as a result of the broken promise to abolish tuition fees.

In a sign that not everyone knows who he is, or is unsure what to feel about him, the top 10 is completed by 'idiot', 'nothing', 'who?', 'OK' and 'unsure'. Two people described the Deputy PM as a 'poodle', four said he was a 'sell-out' and one branded him a 'tosser'. One called him a 'slag', another said 'numbskull' and two said 'pillock' Popular responses to Lib Dem leader Nick Clegg included 'liar', 'don't know', 'untrustworthy' and 'useless' The overwhelming reaction to Mr Farage was to brand him a 'racist'. Ukip has been dogged by revelations about its candidates and members, with Mr Farage insisting he will take action against those who embarrass the party. But he has also courted controversy by defending a candidate taped mocking 'poofters', referring to a Chinese woman as a 'Chinky bird' and threatening to 'shoot peasants'. The next most frequent reactions to Mr Farage included 'idiot', 'dangerous', 'arrogant' and 'bigot'. The top 10 responses also included 'untrustworthy', 'honest' and 'joke'. Five people said 'frog', five said 'yuk!' and another five replied 'w*nker'. The overwhelming reaction to Ukip leader Nigel Farage was to brand him a 'racist'. Others called him an 'idiot', 'dangerous', 'arrogant' and 'bigot' Daisy Powell-Chandler, a consultant at Populus, said: 'It is a fact ignored by most politicians that the public aren't paying attention most of the time. 'Voters have families, jobs and bills that are much more interesting to them than today's policy launch or staged visit.' As the election approaches on May 7, more information will start trickle through. 'But many of the electorate will be choosing who to vote for (or whether to vote at all) based on how each party leader scores on the 'blink test' – the immediate reaction when they see or hear party leaders in the media. This poll shows precisely that. 'It is clear from the results that all political leaders are polarising figures with strong downsides. People think Cameron is arrogant, Miliband is weak, Clegg cannot be trusted, and Farage is a racist. 'But the flipside of these criticisms are things we like about them: Cameron may come across as smug but he is smooth and competent – an assertive leader. 'Ed is weird but caring and intelligent. Clegg is the likeable liberal and Farage a charismatic, funny man. 'Over the course of the campaign, the electorate need to decide which of these attributes are most important and the emotional connections that the public make with these leaders are likely to be an important factor in deciding who the next Prime Minister is.'","Cameron, Miliband, Clegg and Farage subjected to 'blink test' polling .

Ms Gibson, founder of the popular Whole Pantry app, has faced intense criticism since doubts were raised about whether she has terminal cancer. Ms Wilson, author of I Quit Sugar, told Daily Mail Australia that the incident was 'unfortunate' and that health bloggers have a huge responsibility to their followers. 'The real issue that's going on is there's a lot of people out there not taking on board the responsibility that comes with all this,' she said. Scroll down for video . I Quit Sugar author Sarah Wilson told Daily Mail Australia many bloggers are 'not taking on board the responsibility' that comes with publishing . Whole Pantry founder Belle Gibson last week said she would issue an explanatory statement, but it has not materialised . 'I don't know that you need to be a dietitian to share information about your health journey. 'If you are somebody who works online and you claim to be a (health) blogger you have to take on certain responsibilities. 'You have to ensure you train yourself up in all of that (science). That's what I see isn't happening. 'There's a lot of people out there who are't taking on the responsibility of being a disseminator of information. 'We've got to be very transparent and acknowledge the science is not categorical - but respect the science that is there.' Ms Wilson has said in a blog about the issue that 'diet can't cure disease'. Ms Gibson has stayed mum about her health since admitting in an interview with The Australian that her previous claims cancer had spread to her blood, spleen, uterus and liver may have been a 'misdiagnosis'. In the weeks since doubts were raised about Belle Gibson's cancer and charitable donations, her US and Australian publishers have withdrawn support for her recipe books . In the weeks since, her US and Australian publishers have withdrawn support for her recipe books.

In an interview with Daily Mail Australia last Tuesday, Ms Gibson said she understood why many of her followers were upset, but she criticised the 'maliciousness' of some critics. She said she would release a statement addressing concerns about her, but that it was 'taking longer than anticipated' due to 'constantly arising issues' and articles she needed to stay on top of. Asked if the statement would address concerns about her medical history, she said: 'Of course, and every which otherwise possible.'

aa11f5cdb7409f40dd89c5b560819a6b2f1bbd46,"A lifesaving vaccine against meningitis has not yet been  introduced because the NHS has failed to agree a price . A lifesaving vaccine against meningitis B could be given to babies for just £20 a dose – but it has yet to be introduced because the NHS has failed to agree a price after nine months of negotiations. Bexsero, the first jab to protect against the leading cause of life-threatening bacterial meningitis, was recommended for all infants as part of a national immunisation programme in March 2014. The Joint Committee on Vaccination and Immunisation said approval was subject to a cost-effective price being agreed between the manufacturer and the Department of Health, with talks beginning in July 2014. The maximum price being considered under negotiations is around £20 – a significant saving compared with GlaxoSmithKline's 'list price' of £75. Children need three doses in the first year of life, making the maximum final bill for the 700,000 born each year in England and Wales £42million. GPs are also paid a £7.50 fee for each dose administered. Campaigners have warned the lack of urgency from health officials is costing lives. Meningitis B can kill a healthy child within hours of the first symptoms. Since the vaccine was licensed two years ago there have been 1,130 cases, of which at least 452 people died or suffered disabilities. Chris Head, chief executive of the Meningitis Research Foundation, said: 'These price negotiations have been ongoing since July 2014. 'Meanwhile babies and children continue to die or suffer devastating injury, with lifelong costs to the government of someone seriously disabled from the disease ranging from £3million to £4.5million.' Earlier this week Health Secretary Jeremy Hunt said he wanted to introduce the vaccine on the NHS as soon as possible but his hands will be tied by General Election 'purdah' after the middle of next week. A Department of Health spokesman said: 'We are very clear that we want to see this vaccine introduced as soon as possible to help protect children from this devastating disease – but only at a price that represents good value for money for the NHS.'

So perhaps it is unsurprising that Egyptian architects have taken inspiration from the Pyramids at Giza to create a new skyscraper in the capital Cairo. Plans for a spectacular addition to the city's skyline have been unveiled and the shape will look very familiar - not only is the pyramid building borrowing from Ancient Egypt, at 200 metres (656ft) tall, it will be taller than the Great Pyramid itself and the highest building in the country. Scroll down for video . The Zayed Crystal Spark project will feature not one, but two pyramid shaped features. The smaller pyramid at the front will boast an impressive entrance and walkway, surrounded by cascading waterfalls . The Great Pyramid is thought to have been built around 2550BC and reaches 147 metres (481ft). There are three pyramids at Giza - built as burial chambers for three important kings, Khufu, Khafre and Menkaure - and they are famed as one of the original Seven Wonders of the World. The modern project will be known as the Zayed Crystal Spark, occupying a 798,000-square metre spot in West Cairo’s Sheikh Zayed district. It will be multi-purpose and have potential to be used for administrative, commercial and entertainment ventures. The development would be created by real estate developers and the New Urban Communities Authority (NUCA). The Ministry of Housing have announced plans for a spectacular 200 metre high pyramid skyscaper, which will be the tallest building in the country. The shining pillar will be adorned with a glowing capstone and commemorate the nation's prized landmarks .

e98f71ab88cf1951cd53549071672dd62cdd02a3,"Most infections are caused by bacteria on the patient's skin entering the surgical wound . Scientists in the U.S. have devised an implant in a tiny silk 'purse' that kills infections after surgery and then dissolves in the body. Up to four in 100 people undergoing surgery in the UK will develop an infection, and this can prolong hospital stays by as much as nine days. Surgical wound infections are the leading cause of hospital readmissions after operations, according to a study published last month. Most infections are caused by bacteria on the patient's skin entering the surgical wound. The most common culprits are Staphylococcus aureus bacteria, responsible for 20 per cent of surgical site infections, coagulase negative staphylococcus, and enterococcus bacteria. The infection can usually be treated with antibiotics but sometimes patients need more complex treatment, including further surgery. The new implant uses heat to kill off bacteria. It consists of a tiny, magnesium coil wrapped in a pocket of silk protein, and is implanted during surgery - if the patient later shows sign of infection, the implant can be switched on using a remote control. This raises the temperature of the coil. The silk protein protects the coil - both harmlessly dissolve in the body over the next fortnight. This is an improvement on previous medical implant devices, which are made from non-degradable materials that need to be removed. Researchers at Tufts University have used the implant in mice infected with Staphylococcus aureus, raising its temperature for two periods of ten minutes. Within 24 hours the tissue was infection-free. The device, including the coil, completely dissolved after 15 days. 'This is an important step forward for the development of on-demand medical devices that can be turned on remotely,' the researchers said. 'These wireless strategies could help manage post-surgical infection, for example, or pave the way for eventual ""wi-fi"" drug delivery.' The team has also carried out experiments using remote control to deliver antibiotics to treat E.coli and Staphylococcus aureus. Stella Vig, consultant vascular and general surgeon at Croydon University Hospital, said: 'This is an exciting new concept and an innovative tool against the war of surgical site infection. This new purse could allow a reduction of bacterial load with an implantable device . The concept of reducing bacterium within the tissues and thereby reducing risk of infections is not new, and was previously achieved by deploying antibiotic beads within the tissues. These required retrieval and therefore are not used routinely. 'This new device would allow a reduction of bacterial load with an implantable device, which then disappears without the need for surgery to remove it. 'Surgical site infections are costly as they increase the length of stay for patients and can lead to further surgery.' Meanwhile, a team at the University of South Florida has developed a new antibiotic to fight the superbug methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus or MRSA, which kills thousands of people worldwide each year. The bug is a form of Staphylococcus aureus which does not respond to the usual antibiotics. The new treatment is based on a class of drugs called quinazolines, which have been used in treating malaria and cancer. They have recently been shown to act on bacteria, too. 'In recent years, MRSA has become resistant to vancomycin, our most valuable treatment option against staphylococcal infections,' said Dr Lindsey N. Shaw, whose team developed the new drugs. 'Bacterial disease remains the second-leading cause of death globally, especially among children and the elderly. 'We need new drugs to fight these infections.'","Surgical wound infections are the leading cause of hospital readmissions .

A decorated female police officer who sued Britain's biggest police force for racial discrimination after claiming she was called a n***** by a colleague has won her case and will return to work. Ricky Haruna, 39, whose duties included guarding Kate Middleton, said she was fired from London's Metropolitan Police last June after complaining about racism and launched a case for harassment and wrongful dismissal. She is now returning to duty after an appeals tribunal backed her claims. PC Haruna was sacked from the force after what she called a 'malicious arrest' over an alleged fraud, one of three claims which led to her dismissal, and which she was later cleared of. She told the tribunal the Met only took disciplinary action against her because she pursued the racism complaints. She said: 'There was no evidence on which any reasonable, unbiased panel would have dismissed me.' The racist abuse started in 2010 when a suspected shoplifter called her 'midnight' - a racist term used in South London. She said instead of supporting her other officers present 'appeared to laugh'. She added she did not receive support from senior officers when she told them a colleague called her 'a n*****'. She said: 'After that I was harassed and ­ victimised by racist police officers and those that support and cover up for racists in senior management.' She also said she was excluded from a staff Christmas dinner, telling the tribunal: 'I was the only black police officer and only female police officer based in that office at the time and I felt singled out and picked on.' She was sacked seven years after she was pictured alongside Kate Middleton - then Prince William's girlfriend - and who she regularly escorted. PC Haruna was sacked from the force after a 'malicious arrest' over an alleged fraud which she was later cleared of. She is pictured holding the two commendations which she was awarded by the force in 2007 .

She saved the lives of two people during her career and was awarded two commendations.

0ed40867896644f7d67fa2a21c99cb03425d8b5d,"It was the final minute of a one-sided game and Everton winger Christian Atsu set off on one last attack. Sprinting in front of him was Ross Barkley and Atsu wasted no time sending the England man clear. As Tim Krul raced out, Barkley danced around him, the ball never leaving his feet and - with the goal at his mercy - he gracefully applied the finishing touch. Goodison Park, at long last, was exultant and all around this old stadium, fans punched the air in celebration. On the touchline, Roberto Martinez was a little more reserved but there is no doubt a weight had been lifted from his shoulders. This was a big day for the manager and his team, but they came through it with panache. In the end they beat Newcastle 3-0 but that score might have been six. Click here to read Dominic King's full match report . Host commentator . Everton move six points clear of the Premier League relegation zone with what turned out to be a comfortable win for the home side in the end. The Toffees took the lead through James McCarthy before Romelu Lukaku added a second from the penalty spot. Everton's day was made easier when Newcastle captain Fabricio Coloccini was sent off for a dangerous lunging tackle on Aaron Lennon before Ross Barkley added a third in the closing stages of the match. Substitute Ross Barkley shows Kone how it is done by rounding Krul before placing the ball into an empty net. Kone rounds Krul after dodging several challenges from Newcastle's defenders but he runs out of space to score. He probably should have squared the ball to a team-mate but his goalscoring instinct saw him try to score a goal of his own. Atsu comes on for the final five minutes of this afternoon's match at Goodison Park. Sissoko, who is captaining Newcastle following Coloccini's sending off, made Howard make his first real save of the afternoon with a powerful shot at goal. Howard made a good save to his left before shouting at his defenders. Osman, who has been in impressive form, just tested Krul with an effort but the Dutchman was able to palm the ball to safety. The Toffees are not exactly pushing for a third goal but I suppose they are content with their two-goal advantage. Newcastle, on the other hand, are starting to tire due to their numerical disadvantage. Gutierrez replaces Riviere as 10-man Newcastle attempt to close up shop. They know they are out of the game now so it's just a case of keeping the scoreline down to as low as possible. Newcastle's day has been made even worse as their captain has been sent off for a disgusting challenge - if you can call it that - on Lennon. He was incredibly late and his studs were raised as he made a lazy attempt to win back possession for his side. Carver throws on Cabella for Ameobi immediately after Everton's second. Lukaku adds a crucial second goal by converting the penalty from 12 yards. He slots the ball past Krul before running away in celebration. Gouffran is penalised for a clumsy tackle on Aaron Lennon. Kone is being given the time and space to dictate play in the middle of the park but his final pass leaves a lot to be desired. Ayoze Perez came on at half-time in place of Obertan. A positive move by John Carver, who will feel his side can get something out of today's game. Just to recap, here's how McCarthy scored his first goal of the season for Everton. That strike could be pivotal in terms of the Toffees' hopes of staying in the Premier League. A nervous Everton side go into the interval with a 1-0 lead. McCarthy's goal was somewhat fortunate as Krul should have done a lot better but the Toffees will take any kind of fortune given this position in the league. The home crowd are starting to vent their frustrations at Everton despite still being in the lead. Toffees fans will be desperate for their side to open up a two-goal lead in order to ensure they take all three points. The Toffees have grown in confidence since taking the lead through McCarthy. Kone appears to be enjoying a free role just behind Lukaku, while the Belgium international is holding the ball up well. Baines is starting to have some joy down the left. Janmaat is struggling to deal with Baines' runs from deeps. The England left back could have some joy today. Nice moment at Goodison Park. Jonas Gutierrez has just started warming up, running alongside the Family Enclosure towards the Gwladys Street end, both of which are the domain of home supporters. As he made his way to the corner flag on his short shuttle sprint, there was spontaneous applause from Evertonians, a mark of respect for what he has been through. Everton are starting to get a real grip on this game. Ryan Taylor received a yellow card for bringing down the marauding Lennon. Good atmosphere inside Goodison Park, none of the tension that made the first 30 minutes of the Europa League contest with Dynamo Kiev so uncomfortable. Everton have had the better of the play so far and look fresher, thanks to Roberto Martinez making five changes from that 2-1 win on Thursday. It’s a big game for Everton and they look primed to get the result they need particularly now that James McCarthy has given them the lead. Lukaku holds the ball up before laying it on to McCarthy who scores his first goal of the season with a driven shot at goal. Krul committed himself to diving to his right, however McCarthy sent the ball in the opposite corner. Both sides have failed to really trouble the opposing goalkeeper in the first 17 minutes of the match. Newcastle are just shading the possession stats. Martinez will also need help from his goalkeeper Tim Howard, who has not been in the best of form this season. The former Manchester United man will surely take confidence in his early save. Everton's last home win in the Premier League came back in December when Martinez's side beat QPR 3-1. The Toffees will surely have to improve their home form if they cant to climb the table and ensure they are not involved in a relegation scrap. Lukaku, who found the back of the net against Dynamo Kiev on Thursday, stings Krul's gloves with a powerful shot at goal. He will be desperate to live up to his price-tag and help Everton pull away from the relegation zone. Newcastle have started the match extremely brightly. Obertan tested Howard with a powerful effort before Williamson's shot was cleared off the line. Everton: Howard; Baines, Jagielka, Alcaraz, Coleman; McCarthy, Gibson, Lennon, Osman; Kone, Lukaku . Newcastle: Krul; Janmaat, Coloccini, Williamson, R.Taylor; Colback, Sissoko; Obertan, Gouffran, Ameobi; Riviere . The attention switches from the top half of the table to the bottom half where Everton are in desperate need of a win. Roberto Martinez's side are currently just three points away from the Barcalys Premier League drop zone. Newcastle, on the other hand, are sitting comfortably in mid-table. Everton will look to pull clear of the relegation zone in the Premier League with three points against mid-table Newcastle at Goodison Park. Roberto Martinez's side have struggled this season - a surprise given their impressive fifth-placed finish last year - and are currently only three points away from the bottom three. Newcastle, on the other hand, have been secure in mid-table for the majority of this season. They have dropped away from the clubs towards the top of the league, but still find themselves 10 points away from the relegation zone. Three points against Everton would almost certainly secure their Premier League status for another season.","James McCarthy scored past Tim Krul in the 20th minute .

Police have investigated four alleged victims who say they were abused in the 1980s and 1990s by Scott Rogers, who was killed in the US after becoming a local television celebrity there. Three of the men claiming that Rogers attacked them have only come forward after he was shot dead in August by Mathew Hodgkinson, who also killed himself. Investigation: Scott Rogers is accused of molesting at least four young boys while living in Britain . Rogers - known as Richard Scott-Rogers when he lived in Britain - was charged with abusing the other boy more than 20 years ago, but was cleared in 1993 after a trial. Before he moved to the US, Rogers founded the Academy of Dancing and Performing Arts in Bury St Edmunds, which was described as a 'supposedly religious cult' by the local council. Rogers allegedly held 'sleepovers' with young students, where he would 'cuddle them in their sleeping bags', according to parents. He then moved to Baton Rouge, Louisiana, where he hosted a weekend morning TV show called Around Town, making him a minor celebrity in the area. But in August last year, Rogers, 52, was murdered by Mathew Hodgkinson, a former lover of his who had married his daughter Kimmy as part of an immigration scam. School: Rogers founded the Academy of Dancing and Performing Arts in Bury St Edmunds, Suffolk in 1983 . Hodgkinson, 36, then turned the gun on himself, and died in hospital eight days later. After Rogers' death, Suffolk Police appealed for any victims to come forward, and were contacted by three men who said they were abused at the dance school in Bury St Edmunds. Killer: Rogers was shot dead in August by his son-in-law and ex-lover Mathew Hodgkinson, pictured . The force, working with officers from the Metropolitan Police's Operation Yewtree, recorded their claims and referred them to specialist agencies which support child abuse victims. However, they will not be able to take any further action because Rogers' death means the investigation has now been closed. A Suffolk Police crime report uncovered by a MailOnline freedom of information request said: 'Three new victims of child abuse reported to the Suffolk police sexual abuse by Richard Scott-Rogers. 'These historic incidents were recorded as notifiable crimes. Police provided support to these victims. There are no further lines of enquiry to complete in relation to the investigation with no other parties involvement. 'Given the suspect had died these crimes are therefore finalised in accordance with Home Office crime recording outcomes.' The three new victims brings the total number of British complainants to four, including the boy who made the original abuse claims in the 1990s. Following Rogers' death, it emerged that the authorities had recently taken away his adopted 10-year-old son and two-year-old foster son after finding out about his past. He was due to give evidence to a grand jury on the day he was killed, after police discovered that he had lied on the forms he used to apply to become a foster parent. Note: Hodgkinson left this note after killing Rogers and then shooting himself . Hodgkinson wrote an apparent suicide note found in the home he shared with his wife and father-in-law, saying: 'They broke our happy loving home. They do not get to take Scott too.' Soon after Rogers was killed, two anonymous British men appeared on a radio show and accused him of molesting them when they were young boys. One of the alleged victims, who said he met Rogers at the dance academy, claimed to have been abused from the age of 13. It is not known whether the men who made those claims are the same as the complainants who have contacted the police.","EXCLUSIVE: Scott Rogers was shot dead by his ex-lover  in August .

fb14b821975891645cd8c781da001709d19d746d,"I'm 33 and have been single for nearly four years. Most of my friends hint, imply or say it's my fault for being too shallow, picky and prone to falling for bad boys. I use Tinder, the dating app synonymous with casual sex, to meet attractive men who meet my high standards. Yvette Caster, 33, had been single for four years, before she decided to do an experiment where she swiped right to all men on Tinder for a week . It's a great way of filtering out those you find physically unattractive - just swipe left and they can't even message you. If you like them you swipe right and, if they feel the same, you can chat. Most of the time I swipe right to one in 50 - many are too old (over 35), too young (under 25), too dull (into sport), too much of a party animal or simply too ugly. But, after another friend accused me of being picky, I decided to see what would happen if I swiped right to ALL men on Tinder for a week. Here's what happened. Sunday . The first day is the worst. Within a few minutes I've swiped right to someone with head to foot tattoos, a man with his three children and lots of frowning blokes in their pants. After an hour I'm exhausted, depressed and have opened the flood gates for 80, mostly unsuitable, suitors. Monday . I get up at 6.30am to swipe right to man who looks like a serial killer, a Ricky Gervais double and a range of football logos (you can put any image as your profile picture). Then a message from Tinder appears. They've noticed my promiscuous swiping and I can't 'like' another man for another 24 hours. Why would I want to? I've already received 43 matches and seven messages before 9am. After the first day of swiping right to all men, the London-based journalist was met with 43 matches and seven messages, all before 9am . Tuesday . I have messages from 22 men and am chatting to all of them to avoid being 'too picky'. The fact they want to talk to me is a revelation. I usually have messages from two men a week, tops. Of the 22, a couple are lascivious but the majority are from nice, down to earth guys. It's just a shame so few of them can spell. I haven't messaged any of them first, either, as I prefer them to do the chasing. Wednesday . It's only just dawning on me how much admin is involved in being promiscuous. Keeping 22 different chats going is hard work and confusing, especially when so many men are called Dave. At times I copy and paste the same message to all the guys, which is rude but it's either that or no reply. I can't quite believe so many of them are being so polite. My normal Tinder experience, picking only the hot guys, is sleazy pick up lines followed by unsolicited pictures or their penis or even indecent videos. Maybe I really could find a boyfriend this way after all. Tinder clocked on to Yvette's promiscuous swiping and sent her a message banning her from 'liking' anyone else for 24 hours . Thursday . The chats have gone so well that I've given my number to three men, although I'm still doubtful about whether I could be physically attracted to them. On the one hand, this whole thing feels slightly immoral, or at least an exercise in leading men on. But on the other, if I think about my exes, I'd probably have swiped left to at least a couple as they won me over with charm and humour, not looks. Friday . I've been asked on three dates - nice dinner dates, not hook ups. One guy has outright asked to be my boyfriend. Another, who is far too young really, has been keeping me entertained with perfect flirty texts. I'm starting to think this is the way forward. The 33-year-old found that attractive men were more likely to message sleazy pick-up lines (left), whereas less attractive men tended to be more polite and seek relationships . Saturday . Just because I can, I go back to swiping right on all men again - men with big beards (yuk), men pictured with their much better looking friend and men who think women are attracted to Star Wars screen grabs. I also have 69 matches and those dates to prepare for. In the end, none of them prove to be The One, but I did have some lovely evenings - good company and intelligent conversation. Would I do it again? Why not? Some men need a chance to win your heart while others, well, they're just very bad at choosing profile pics.","London-based journalist, Yvette Caster, has been single for four years .

f411fef31493f612945f2cb1c2a5d56312083bf9,"A Los Angeles attorney and single mom who is battling terminal lung cancer that has spread to her brain is launching a campaign for the right to end her own life, in a case that echoes that of Brittany Maynard. Terminal: Christy O'Donnell, 46, is battling lung and brain cancer and now fighting to die with dignity . Christy O'Donnell, a former police officer, says she has exhausted all her medical options in her battle against Stage IV lung adenocarcinoma, which has masticated into a golf ball-sized tumor in her brain. Despite surviving the six months life expectancy she was given upon being diagnosed last June, the 46-year-old has been told her death will be painful, as her lungs continue to fill with fluid that will inevitably drown her. 'I think it's a terrible injustice that I don't have the choice to die in the manner I want to and instead that I'm forced to very likely die in protracted pain and I might even die alone,' O'Donnell told People magazine in a new feature. O'Donnell is now using what time she has left to support a  Death with Dignity law in California, having been inspired by Maynard, the 29-year-old California woman who moved to Oregon to take her own life last year, ending a long battle with brain cancer. O'Donnell says she wants to be able to do the same in the bed of her home in Valencia, with her 20-year-old daughter, Bailey Donorovich, holding her hand. She says her greatest fear is that her daughter will come home one day and find her mother dead. O'Donnell said she went to the doctors last year after waking up one morning and not being able to read properly. A big book worm, she had been reading before going to bed the night before, only to wake and hardly make out the letters of some words. She had her eyes checked, but the results came back fine. O'Donnell then called her physician and explain what happened, and the doctor told her to immediately go to the emergency room. Legacy: Brittany Maynard, 29, moved from California to Oregon - one of five U.S. states where terminally ill patients are legally allowed to kill themselves - to take her own life in November . An MRI and some other tests confirmed her shocking diagnosis. 'Bailey grabbed my hand and I just started crying and said, ''I'm so sorry'',' O'Donnell told People. 'What I was really saying was, ''I'm so sorry I'm going to die and leave you without a mom''.' O'Donnell underwent chemotherapy and has taken part in numerous clinical trials. However her prognosis has not changed. 'There is not anything medically we have not explored,' O'Donnell said. 'So it is not like I haven't exhausted all my options. My opinion is an informed one.' Doctors say the tumor in O'Donnell's lungs causes fluid to build up. She will soon have to undergo a painful procedure to empty the fluid, however it will fill up again almost immediately. 'There's a good likelihood (my daughter) will come home from work, come home from school, and find me dead,' an overwhelmed O'Donnell told People TV. In memoriam: Three California lawmakers are promoting right-to-die legislation with the family of Brittany Maynard (pictured with husband Dan Diaz), a terminally ill woman who ended her life early under Oregon law on November 1 . Love: Brittany Maynard and Dan Diaz married at the Beltane Ranch in California's wine country on September 29, 2012 . O'Donnell is now hoping to fight not just to stay alive until Brittany's 21st birthday in June, but for the law to allow her to die the way she wants. 'In the short amount of time I have left, I want to spend it with my daughter - she and I are doing this together - and I want to speak out in whatever way possible to start that dialogue with the public, with the legislature and the courts, and try and impact change,' O'Donnell said. O'Donnell's case is incredible similar to that of Maynard. Her family - lead by mother Debbie Ziegler - are now trying to pass a bill that would allow terminally ill patients to kill themselves in California with drugs and dosages recommended by a doctor. The practice is legal in five states, including Oregon, where Maynard moved before her suicide on November 1. Hoping for change: Debbie Ziegler, the mother of Brittany Maynard, speaks in support of proposed legislation allowing doctors to prescribe life ending medication on Wednesday January 21, 2015, in Sacramento . The 29-year-old San Francisco Bay Area woman had made her case public with online videos, saying in clips that were viewed tens of millions of times that she should have been able to legally obtain life-ending drugs in California. 'Most Californians would not be able to do what we did,' Ziegler said. 'They couldn't leave their homes; they couldn't leave their jobs; they couldn't leave their families, their friends, their pets. 'We had to do all of that. It added another layer of pain.' Maynard wrote in her final Facebook post: ""Goodbye to all my dear friends and family that I love. Today is the day I have chosen to pass away with dignity in the face of my terminal illness, this terrible brain cancer that has taken so much from me ... but would have taken so much more .","Christy O'Donnell, 46, diagnosed with Stage IV lung adenocarcinoma in June and given six months to live .

31aeaa9d37af35d148aa7b8ecedd9cbafda96338,"Michael Vaughan believes Alastair Cook is 'clearly bitter', and must set aside his own World Cup disappointment for the good of his England team at the start of their Ashes year. Cook claimed on Wednesday that England's decision to replace him as captain with Eoin Morgan, at the 11th hour before the global tournament in Australia and New Zealand, was proved 'probably wrong' by subsequent events. England made an embarrassing early exit at the hands of Bangladesh, before the knockout stages were under way. Alastair Cook was replaced as Engtland's one-day captain before this year's World Cup . Former captain Vaughan interprets Cook's remarks as a sign that he is still struggling to come to terms with what happened after losing his 50-over role because of his continued poor batting form. Cook will nonetheless lead England in three Tests against the West Indies, on a tour starting early next month, before returning home to face first New Zealand and then Australia this summer. BBC pundit Vaughan said: 'He's clearly bitter. 'I think that's a bad mentality to have, when you think he's going to be back leading the team in a couple of weeks' time.' Cook led England to a Champions Trophy final on home soil two years ago, and the top of the world rankings, but their recent one-day international record under him deteriorated. Vaughan added: 'Alastair Cook's last six captaincy jobs in (ODI) series for England, he lost every single one. 'The only series they've won was away in the West Indies, when he wasn't the captain.' Michael Vaughan claims Cook is 'bitter' about the decision to replace him as captain . Cook could only watch from afar as England beat only Scotland and Afghanistan in their World Cup campaign under Morgan, but he sensed they were 'shell-shocked' and in need of 'real leadership'. Vaughan argues Cook must move on, and start scoring prolifically again - as he has for the vast majority of his record-breaking career. 'I don't think it's great that the captain comes out and criticises the leadership of the captain that takes over - but he's clearly bitter. 'He's got to clear that out of his head, because it's so important that by the time he gets to the West Indies England need him scoring runs. 'He has to score runs in the Caribbean; he has to get runs against New Zealand - so by the time the Ashes arrive in July, no one is talking about Alastair Cook's position in the Test team. 'He hasn't scored a hundred in any format of the game for two years. That has to change in the West Indies.'","Alastair Cook was replaced as England's one-day captain .

b2a1f80918967220f3e85055603953f52495c81e,"A cannabis-smoking supporter of hate preacher Anjem Choudary has walked free from court after grooming a 15-year-old schoolgirl on Facebook. Mansoor Miah sent explicit photographs to the schoolgirl before inviting her to a hotel to have sex with him. The 22-year-old from Kilburn, north west London, even filmed himself in sordid trysts and sent them to the youngster who was using her Nintendo DS to access Facebook. He was spared jail after a court heard how Miah, who has shared several of Choudary's fundamentalist tweets, struck up an online conversation about the Koran. Mansoor Miah walked free from court after sending explicit messages to a 15-year-old schoolgirl he was grooming over social media . When she told him she was uninterested in religion Miah, who worked in Tesco, carried on their conversations which turned to a sexual nature despite the girl having told him how old she was. He was handed a suspended sentence of 16 months at Southward Crown Court today. Earlier the court heard how he began speaking to the girl about Islam but soon forced the conversation in a sexual direction. 'Having talked about Islam, undeterred, Mr Miah began to chat the complainant up,' prosecutor Stephen Requena said. 'Having talked about Islam he proceeds to chat her up, having established her real age. 'He praises her physical appearance and asks if she has a boyfriend.' The court heard how he sent her explicit photographs of himself, urging her to do the same before performing a sex act in front of her on webcam. He was arrested last year after one of the girl's teachers told her mother of their plans to meet in a Premier Inn in Kent. 'The mother, it seems, was scared and felt her daughter was in danger when this was discovered. The 22-year-old is a supporter of hate preacher Anjem Choudary having shared some of the cleric's posts on Twitter . 'She describes her daughter as not that mature, which leaves her vulnerable,' added Mr Requena. The youngster was said to have had her laptop confiscated after engaging in explicit conversations with men on social media before meeting Miah. In a statement provided by her mother she was described as 'shy' and and 'uncomfortable' with new people. Despite admitting to knowing the girl was underage, Miah claimed that he did not target her, adding: 'She looks 20.' Support: Miah is a fan of Islamist hate preacher Anjem Choudary (above) 'He didn’t seek her out, he befriended her because she was a friend of a friend, not because she looks young, she looks 20,' said hi barrister Edward Jones said. 'This was a young man confused about religious beliefs, smoking cannabis to significant degree. He has now sought to reform himself. 'He made a catastrophic error of judgement which he said would not be repeated.' Sentencing, Judge Nicholas Loraine-Smith said while the defendant had planned 'some sort of sexual activity', he was not a 'predatory paedophile'. 'You have not repeated this offence, so there is no evidence you are a predatory paedophile of the type I’m afraid we often see in this court, and the fact you didn't try again allows me to accept you were remorseful for your behaviour months before the police intervened. 'A suspended sentence is appropriate. 'A prison sentence to mark the seriousness of what you did, and a course of treatment to ensure it doesn't happen again and to protect young girls.' The judge added that if the pair had met up at the hotel or if Miah had approached another girl his sentence would have been more severe. 'The victim was just 15 and was young for her age, her mother said she was vulnerable and not streetwise. 'You had no sexual experience. You were feeling depressed and isolated, you were smoking cannabis. 'I accept you were immature for your age and once these conversations were finished you did not talk to other girls.' He also praised him for being 'helpful' to the police, who described him as a 'different person' from the one who had committed the offences. Miah was also put on the sex offenders register and made the subject of a sexual offences prevention order. .","Mansoor Miah contacted the girl over social media as she played Nintendo .

The post also counseled that, despite 2015 marking two years since San Francisco's controversial nudity ban, no one has been cited during a naked ride. That appeared to have remained the case with Saturday's ride. However, the same wasn't true for a group of pro-nudity protesters last month when a demonstration in the Castro District was called to mark the second anniversary of the city law, which bans public nudity except at events whose sponsors obtain permits.

Officers said the trio had to be taken into custody instead of being cited because they did not have identification.

3a80ed1ae9e57130e636330a9c55227a325eba47,"Nicola Tweedy, 54, died two days after she had her varicose veins operated on at the Norfolk and Norwich hospital . The death of a woman days after she underwent surgery on her varicose veins could have been prevented, her husband has today claimed. Nicola Tweedy, 54, had the operation at the Norfolk and Norwich University Hospital in March last year and was discharged the same evening. But two days later the mother-of-two was found apparently asleep in her chair at the family home in Pulham Market, Norfolk. When her family failed to rouse the classroom assistant, they called an ambulance. Despite the best efforts of the paramedics called, Mrs Tweedy died. A post-mortem examination later confirmed she had suffered a pulmonary embolism, a blood clot which reached her lungs. An inquest heard staff at the hospital failed to ensure Mrs Tweedy was fully aware of the risk of suffering a blood clot during the operation, because of an 'oversight'. Her husband, Chris Tweedy, 53, said he is now considering taking civil action against the hospital, claiming he believes his wife's death could have been prevented. The postman, who lives with the couple's two children, said: 'They were required to avoid harming her and, tragically, in my opinion, they did not.' South Norfolk MP Richard Bacon said the case was a 'tragedy' which should prompt improvements. He added: 'It is clear to me that more could and should have been done to mitigate the risks of what was deemed to be appropriate surgery for Mrs Tweedy, most crucially to place Mrs Tweedy and her family in a position to make a fully informed choice about whether to proceed with the operation. 'Any hospital treating over half a million people each year will occasionally not do everything perfectly. People are only human. 'But in the post-Mid Staffs world, when things have been less than perfect, patients and families now expect - and frankly are entitled to expect - much greater openness.' Consultant vascular surgeon Robert Brightwell admitted to the inquest in Norwich that a thrombosis risk assessment had not been completed. That meant the 54-year-old was not fully informed about the dangers of the surgery, including the increased risk for those with a high body mass index. Nurse Susan Brown said she accepted it was 'an oversight' and that a checklist had not been completed on the patient's discharge notes. Coroner Jacqueline Lake gave a narrative conclusion that Mrs Tweedy died following a 'rare but recognised' risk of surgery, adding she will write a report so that future deaths may be prevented. She said she was satisfied that the operation itself had been conducted appropriately. But raised concerns that Mrs Tweedy had not been given the correct leaflets on her care. Speaking after the inquest Mr Tweedy said his family's lives had been 'damaged beyond repair'. He described his wife and his 'happy, smiling soul-mate'. Mrs Tweedy's husband, Chris, 53, who lives with the couple's two children, said he believes his wife's death could have been prevented . A post mortem examination revealed Mrs Tweedy died of a pulmonary embolism, a blood clot in her lungs . He added: 'Nicky was a happy, smiling, laughing, easy going, fun loving person all of her life. 'She was someone who loved, cared for, guided, supported and helped so many people throughout her life. 'In my opinion, the Norfolk and Norwich  would have done nothing to learn the lessons from my wife's death, and to materially revise their protocols and procedures, which they have subsequently done, without my formal complaint and, even after that, without the very considerable pressure I have placed upon them, both personally and through other organisations. 'In the United Kingdom thousands of patients die a preventable death every year from hospital acquired venous thromboembolism. 'Many thousands more have to live with the life changing consequences. 'That, in my opinion, is a national scandal.' A hospital spokeswoman expressed sympathy to the Tweedy family. She added: 'Mrs Tweedy died of a rare but recognised complication of surgery, estimated to occur in approximately 0.01 per cent of cases, in other words one in 10,000 patients. 'While it is possible to reduce the risks of surgery they can never be eliminated entirely. 'The trust commissioned an independent review in order to identify any ways in which we could improve our services. 'Once we have the coroner's recommendations we will review these to identify any further opportunities for improvement.' Lawyer Sharon Allison, of Ashton KCJ which represented the family, said: 'My client and his family are understandably devastated beyond words at their loss. 'They have many questions relating to the hospital's protocols concerning blood clotting risks.' An inquest heard how a pre-surgery risk assessment was not completed, meaning Mrs Tweedy was not fully aware of the risks of suffering a blood clot during her operation .","Nicola Tweedy had an operation on her varicose veins last March .

The indications are that Moores will keep his job, at least for the Test series in the Caribbean, whatever happens at the Sydney Cricket Ground tomorrow, but the last thing he needs is another desperate defeat by minnows. The fact England turned up early yesterday for what used to be known as naughty-boy nets and had a full training session said everything about their need to take something from their worst-ever World Cup. Victory against Afghanistan would perhaps give Moores breathing space before the squad is announced on Tuesday for the three-Test series in the West Indies next month. England will be without Moeen Ali and Chris Woakes, two players who can still expect a one-day future, and it is far from certain that both will be able to take their places on the plane to St Kitts on April 2. Moores attempts to rally his troops on the SCG on Wednesday ahead of their match against Afghanistan . Moeen strained an abdominal muscle when bowling in the defeat by Bangladesh while Woakes has a ‘stress reaction’ in his left foot. It is to be hoped England give games to the two players yet to appear in this World Cup: James Tredwell and Ravi Bopara, who could then be making their final ODI appearances. After the World Cup England must start from scratch with a one-day squad who will be at or near their peak in 2019. That means there is little point in persevering in 50-over cricket beyond tomorrow with the likes of Tredwell, Bopara, Ian Bell, Stuart Broad or Jimmy Anderson, who said on Wednesday he wants to play on. His is not a view shared by former England wicketkeeper Matt Prior. Young England quick Chris Jordan works up a sweat during a tough day of training in the Sydney sunshine . In his Evening Standard column Prior wrote: ‘Men like Ian Bell, Jimmy Anderson and Stuart Broad... remain key members of the Test side, so perhaps it is time for them to concentrate solely on that form of the game, especially with an Ashes summer approaching.’ There is a familiar figure at the helm of the Afghan team in coach Andy Moles, the former Warwickshire batsman. He would have no qualms about piling on the misery for his homeland and said: ‘We still believe we’ve got a scare in us in this World Cup, especially if we show composure at the top of the order. If we hold our nerve and are at our best we can pull off a shock.’","Former England opener Mark Butcher told fans not to watch the Ashes .

Padge-Victoria Windslowe's testimony during her Philadelphia trial included claims she was 'the Michelangelo of buttocks injections' and model Amber Rose was 'a walking billboard' for her work. However, the former 'Black Madam' had no medical training, using only tips she picked up from the overseas doctors who performed her sex change operation and a client of her escort service. Today, she was found guilty of third-degree murder after one of her 'patients', Claudia Aderotimi, 20, a London break-dancer and college student, died from an illegal silicone injection in her buttocks. Scroll down for video . Conviction: Padge-Victoria Windslowe (left), who bragged of carrying out black-market 'body sculpting' on thousands of women, has been convicted of murder after a botched injection killed Claudia Aderotimi (right) Former madam: Windslowe, a former 'Black Madam' (pictured) had no medical training, using only tips she picked up from overseas doctors who performed her sex change operation and a client of her escort service . Miss Aderotimi, who paid $2,000 to be injected by Windslowe at an airport hotel in 2011, was rushed to hospital after complaining of chest pain and shortness of breath. She died just a few hours later. It was later revealed the silicone in her buttocks had moved to her lungs and stopped her heart. During her murder trial, Windslowe said of her 'body sculpting': 'I was the best, and I don't mean that to be cocky,' explaining why celebrities would have sought her out over a licensed plastic surgeon. The 45-year-old described herself as a serial entrepreneur who once ran a transgender escort service, as well as a Gothic hip-hop performer who called herself 'the Black Madam.' Last week, her trial was halted for several days after she was hospitalized with chest pains. She has been in prison since 2012 after an 18-month inquiry led to a homicide ruling and an arrest warrant. The jury got the case Friday. They were choosing between third-degree murder - not premeditated but involves malice - and involuntary manslaughter, involving reckless disregard for a person's life. Aspiring hip-hop artists: Today, the defendant (pictured left and right) was convicted of third-degree murder after Miss Aderotimi, 20, a London dancer and college student, died from a silicone injection in her buttocks . Tragic death: Miss Aderotimi (pictured), who was injected by Windslowe at an airport hotel in the city in 2011, was rushed to hospital after complaining of chest pain and shortness of breath. She died a few hours later . In addition to third-degree murder, Windslowe was also convicted of aggravated assault for injuries to a Philadelphia woman who became seriously ill after paying for one of the injections. And the jury found her guilty of two weapons counts - the weapon in question being the industrial-grade silicone. Windslowe faces 20 to 40 years in prison on the murder conviction alone. Miss Aderotimi's family in England chose not to attend the trial. The long-time friend who accompanied her to Philadelphia to celebrate her birthday also declined to make the trip. The friend's 2012 testimony, read aloud in court, described the meeting as 'a touch-up' after their prior visit to the woman they knew as 'Lillian.' Windslowe name-dropped the likes of rappers Nicki Minaj and Kanye West and athlete Serena Williams during her testimony. She also claimed to have been baptized 'Genevieve' by the late Roman Catholic Cardinal Anthony Bevilacqua. Amber Rose's agents did return messages seeking comment about the claim she was a client. The evidence showed that Windslowe traveled to hotel rooms and 'pumping parties' with her tools of the trade stuffed into a shiny pink purse: a water bottle filled with silicone, a red plastic cup, needles and syringes, and Krazy Glue to close the injection sites. Claims: Windslowe's colorful testimony during her Philadelphia trial included claims she was 'the Michelangelo of buttocks injections' and model Amber Rose (pictured) was 'a walking billboard' for her untrained work . There have been several similar deaths nationwide involving underground buttocks injections. A mother of three who died in Texas after having work done at a tile store died in April 2011. A Columbian couple is serving up to eight years in prison for manslaughter in that case. Windslowe, who went on the run after Miss Aderotimi's death, lowered her head during the closing arguments Friday as a prosecutor described her victim as 'a regular girl' who had asked if the injections could interfere with her ability to have children. When Miss Aderotimi began having chest pains afterward, Windslowe 'kept up that ruse' of being a physician's assistant, Assistant District Attorney Bridget Kirn told the jury last week. 'She put her hand on this young lady's chest as if she were doing an exam,' Kirn said. 'But there was no exam.' Addressing the court, defense lawyer David Rudenstein said the potential dangers of her injections were not clear to his client, Windslowe, because she only knew of satisfied customers. 'Clearly with all the information from this case, we know it shouldn't be done, it's too risky,' Rudenstein told the court. 'We know that now. But we didn't know that then.'","Padge-Victoria Windslowe convicted of third-degree murder by jury today .

811d53b2ea2852190f5b1da3f163dcc18e24a746,"(CNN)""There's a baby. There's a baby."" The frantic voices of rescuers can be heard on the body cam video showing the moment baby Lily was found one week ago. The 18-month-old girl hangs upside down after her mother's car crashed and flipped into a frigid Utah river some 14 hours earlier. A firefighter is seen lifting her tiny body, wrapped in pink, from the red car where Lily's mother, Lynn Jennifer Groesbeck, 25, lost her life. The car landed on its roof in the Spanish Fork River. From the murky waters, the rescuer hands baby Lily to a police officer. He dashes up the rocky banks of the Spanish Fork, pressing the infant close to his chest for warmth. ""Got it,"" the officer is heard saying. Lily is freezing. ""Come on, baby,"" he says. ""She's definitely hypothermic."" In the ambulance, the officer pats little Lily on the back in an attempt to get her breathing. Lily is on her side. She looks pale, her tiny arm appears stiff. ""Come on, sweetie,"" the officer implores. ""Come on, sweetie."" On the ambulance to a hospital, rescuers perform CPR. They try to warm her. ""We're almost there,"" one rescuer is heard to say. ""Are you getting a pulse?"" ""I can't feel anything,"" says another. At the hospital, as Lily is rushed into the emergency room, she vomits. ""We've been doing CPR on her,"" the officer tells emergency room personnel. ""She's been throwing up a little bit."" Those moments captured by the body cam video -- which first aired on CNN affiliate KSL -- were crucial. ""If anything had been different, she might not have made it,"" emergency room doctor Brock Royall told the station. In the ER, Lily opened her eyes as CPR was performed to get her heart pumping, Royall said. Another important factor was a car seat. Lily was in the proper car seat for her age, and the seat appears to have been properly attached. Even though the child was trapped and upside-down, her body remained in the seat and above the frigid water. Doctors say that such low temperatures are dangerous, but even more dangerous if the baby had gotten wet. ""She seems to be doing great,"" said Officer Jason Howard of the Spanish Fork Police Department. ""We were able to get together with her and her family. She was happy and smiling. Seemed to be a normal and happy, healthy baby."" Howard said the toddler temporarily was staying with an aunt and uncle. Her father, Deven Trafny, 34, was out of town on a job at the time of the accident, CNN affiliate KUTV reported. He rushed to his daughter's side as soon as he heard. ""(I) came in, I put my finger in her hand, and I told her her Dad was here, and I love her,"" he told reporters Wednesday. ""I haven't left her bedside since, and I've just been here just sitting next to her waiting for her to get better so she can come home."" Trafny said that Lily is awake and has been singing nursery rhymes. Video of the two of them at a hospital shows her waving at a camera. ""She knows everything she knew before anything happened. It's amazing. Doctors say it's amazing,"" he said. How did toddler survive car crash in Utah river? Lily might have died unseen with her mother had a man not gone fishing in that particular spot last Saturday. The angler waded into the river around noon, then noticed the car wheels-up in the water. The fisherman called emergency dispatch. The water was so cold that, when the rescue was over, seven of the men involved had to be treated for hypothermia. They heaved the car onto its side and saw Groesbeck in the driver's seat. It was clear to them that she was dead. Lily was still strapped into her seat, where she may have been for 14 hours, if the wreck occurred at about 10:30 Friday night, as police believe. Trafny described Groesbeck as the love of his life, according to KUTV: ""I'm going to miss her a lot. I still have to deal with that."" But he also considers himself lucky to still have his daughter -- healthy and alive. ""I'm just blessed. I'm counting all my blessings right now,"" said Trafny.

504b5538a98febc571f24cf6cbeec730e380511b,"The damning thing for Leicester in this match they really needed to win was that there was no cavalry charge, no guns blazing crescendo. Tom Huddlestone was dismissed for second bookable offence with 18 minutes to go but Allan McGregor in the Hull goal had not one meaningful save to make as the clock ticked down. In fact, it was Mark Schwarzer who had to be alert. In the final minute he reacted expertly to stop an Abel Hernandez shot following a quickly-taken free-kick by Dame N’Doye. Had that gone in, the obituaries on Leicester’s Premier League life could have been signed off.

Leicester are seven points from safety, even if Sunderland are dropping like a stone having played a game more. Leicester’s match in hand is against Chelsea. Martin O’Neill was at the King Power Stadium as a guest of the club he served so well in two League Cup triumphs. This season is heading for a more sombre conclusion to those heady days. Nigel Pearson is realistic, knowing uncommon improvement is needed immediately. ‘We’ve got ten games left, six at home, we probably need to win five,’ he said having seen his side win only four times all campaign. ‘When the pressure was on us to go and create I don’t think we did. We were laboured.’ Steve Bruce was disappointed at a different aspect, the clamour for a card from Leicester players when Alex Bruce tackled Riyad Mahrez in the second half. The ball was won but referee Jon Moss produced a yellow, soon after erring similarly in booking Craig Dawson. Leicester City keeper Mark Schwarzer punches clear as Dame N'Doye of Hull and Ritchie De Laet of the Foxes vie for the ball . ‘There is a raging debate about Chelsea in midweek. I’ve seen everybody surround Alex for a red card for his challenge. For me it is a perfectly decent challenge I would expect a centre-half to make,’ said Bruce. ‘If we’re going to go down the route of every other league jumping around, whinging, trying to get people yellow cards and red cards. For me it’s not right.’ When a game begins with six centre-halves on the pitch there is a reasonable assumption goals will be in short supply. Jake Livermore of Hull attempts to keep possession at the King Power Stadium under pressure from Leicester's Esteban Cambiasso . Leicester matched Hull in a 3-5-2 formation, with half a dozen genuine defenders concentrating solely on keeping the ball away from danger. They did their jobs well, in a contest that began so short on opportunities or entertainment mass narcolepsy was an entirely possible outcome. It took Leicester until 62 minutes to register a shot on target, and even that was a mishit cross by Jamie Vardy, requiring a palm over from McGregor. Hull were only marginally better, but should have gone ahead in the 20th minute only for Nikica Jelavic to get himself in a terrible tangle. In a contender for miss of the season, he failed to put boot to ball from six yards with the net open. Huddlestone chipped the ball over the backline of blue shirts to find Ahmed Elmohamady sprinting clear, having timed his run perfectly to stay onside. The Egyptian squared the ball to take out Schwarzer but Jelavic failed badly. Six minutes later he did have the ball in the back of the net. But Moss had already blown for a foul on Schwarzer by N’Doye. Leicester’s best opening of the first-half came in the 34th minute when Mahrez delivered a wicked cross that bent into the area in front of Andrej Kramaric. But the £9million striker was either caught on his heels or disinclined to make the leap required to meet the ball and it drifted wide. Tom Huddlestone puts in a robust challenge on Leicester City striker Andrej Kramaric during the Premier League clash on Saturday . Referee Jonathan Moss hands out the yellow card to Hull City defender Alex Bruce (left) as tempers threatened to boil over . This was a bad game for Kramaric, unable to affect it in any way and he was hooked for Leonardo Ulloa after an hour. Soon after Jelavic headed over from a corner by Gaston Ramirez. That is when Leicester began to make a more concerted effort to win three points rather than one. Vardy was a nuisance all match for the Hull defenders, his pace and energy unsettling. It was he who stretched his legs down the left before cutting in and forcing Huddlestone into a foul he wished not to make. He tried to back out of it but the contact sent Vardy to the floor. Abel Hernandez of Hull City has his head in his hands after a missed chance to fire the Tigers into the lead at the King Power Stadium . Moss, soon after dishing out two wholy incorrect bookings for ‘fouls’ by Dawson and Bruce, got this yellow right. From the free-kick Jeff Schlupp struck a shot that was heading in until Ulloa inadvertently blocked. With the man advantage Leicester pressed but without cultivating anything to truly worry Bruce. The crowd willed the ball in for the final few minutes but boos greeted the final whistle. This felt like a fatal opportunity missed.","Hull midfielder Tom Huddlestone sent off in the second-half for two bookable offences .

But photographer Nick Lariontsev has captured mould in a way that may make you look at that out-of-date bread and cheese in a different way. Using macroscopic photography techniques, he has created a strangely beautiful timelapse video that shows mould fungi as they grow and spread. Using macroscopic photography, Russian photographer Nick Lariontsev has created a captivating yet stomach-churning timelapse video that shows mould fungi as it grows and spread (grab shown) The multicellular filaments slowly spread across the Petri dish before forming mounds and ridges that look more like the alien landscape of another planet. He has also managed to capture the tiny clusters of spores on the end of stalks that give many moulds their dusty appearance. Mr Lariontsev, a photographer based in Russia who posted the video on YouTube, said it took him between two and eight days to capture each of the individual sequences in the film. Among the moulds he filmed using a specially designed set-up was part of the Aspergillus genus, which commonly forms on starchy foods and are also used to help produce sake from rice. Among the moulds in the film are the Aspergillus genus, which commonly forms on starchy foods and are also used to help produce sake from rice. The fungi Cladosporium, which usually grows on dead plant material, are also shown growing their brown and black branches, and the soil-based fungi Trichoderma . Fungi from the group of Cladosporium, which usually grows on dead plant material, are also shown growing their brown and black branches, along with the soil-based fungi Trichoderma. The fungal genus Botrytis, some of which often infect soft fruit like strawberries and grapes, and the genus Mucor, which grow on rotting vegetation, were also captured. Mr Lariontsev set up the Petri dish where he grew his mould so that it would slowly rotate - making one turn every seven days. The result is a rather stomach-churning but strangely captivating four-minute long video showing the fungi as few people will have seen it before. Professor Lynne Boddy, a fungal ecologist at Cardiff University and a member of the British Mycological Society, said: 'Most people think yuk when they see fungi as they see it rot their food and kill their plants. 'But if it wasn't for fungi we would not be here today as it shapes the world around us. 'If fungi did not rot wood and leaves in the forest, then the nutrients locked up inside them would never be freed up in the soil. 'Many fungi also form mycorrhizal relationships with the roots of plants and if it was not for them then the plants could not grow. 'Fungi are actually hugely important yet largely overlooked.' The fungi Botrytis, which often infects on soft fruit like strawberries and grapes, and the fungi Mucor, which grows on rotting vegetation, were also captured. Mr Lariontsev set up the Petri dish where he grew his mould so that it would slowly rotate - making one turn every seven days . It sounds more like the recipe  for a good pasta sauce, but scientists have created a new edible coating that extends the shelf-life of cheese from seafood, rosemary and oregano. The transparent film uses extracts from the shells of crustaceans with oregano and rosemary oils to keep cheese from drying out and help prevent the growth of fungus and bacteria. Tests have shown that the coating is as effective as anti-fungal chemicals and plastic coatings that are currently used to protect some cheeses by the dairy industry. The researchers claim that the new coating will be particularly useful for soft cheeses like ricotta but could also help prevent mature cheeses like brie and blue cheeses from spoiling. While helping to prevent the cheese from going off, it is also completely edible and so will not need to be removed like some artificial rinds that are used. Professor Chelo González, a researcher at the Institute of Food Engineering for Development of the Polytechnic University of Valencia, said: 'The most common causes of deterioration are excessive surface dehydration and the growth of micro-organisms such as fungus or yeasts. 'These produce a strange flavour or odour, a slimy texture and a significant visual alteration. 'Using a natural and edible product reduces the fungal problems and controls the weight loss during the maturing.' The researchers coated Tronchon cheese (labelled queso Tronchon recubierto) with a combination of chitosan, which is extracted from crustacean shells, and essential oils from rosemary and oregano .","Russian photographer Nick Larionstev captured a video of mould growing .

Myers' body was found in Cactus Park, Mesa County on February 28. The teenager had been missing since December 18. Kelly Mae Myers, 18, died of a 'mixed drug intoxication', according to the Mesa County Coroner's office. Her body was found stuffed in a suitcase at a Colorado park on February 28 . Police say Eduardo De La Cruz, 30 (left) was staying at the same hotel where Myers died. Raymond Cordova, 47 (right), an associate of De La Cruz, picked Myers up from her father's house and allegedly dumped her body . Colorado police ruled her death as 'suspicious' but have not yet officially declared it a homicide. Officials said they would not release any more information regarding Myters' cause of death at this time because of the ongoing investigation, according to Fox 13 Now. Myers' body was put inside a suitcase and kept in a West Valley City hotel before it was transported to the Cactus Park area, a search warrant obtained by The Deseret News revealed. Police are currently investigating two persons of interest, Eduardo De La Cruz and Raymond Cordova,  in connection with Myers' disappearance. De La Cruz, 30, is being held on suspicion of trafficking heroin but is not an official suspect in the Myers case, police said. Myers' body was found stuffed in a suitcase at Cactus Park in Mesa County, Colorado, on February 28, two months after police believe the teen died at a West Valley City hotel . He was the alleged ringleader in a drug trafficking organization that supplied 'large quantities of heroin, methamphetamine, cocaine and prescription narcotics'. De La Cruz was named as a person of interest in the Myers case following a wiretap investigation. Myers was last seen in Grand Junction with friends and was believed to be heading to Salt Lake City for a party. Relatives who reported her missing in Colorado said the teenager's disappearance was 'out of character'. Myers' mother Kim Lee told Fox 13 Now she had never heard of De La Cruz or Cordova before they were arrested. 'This wasn't just a piece of trash that you stuffed, and I hate saying that word, but you put in a suitcase,' she said. 'This was a human being, this was my daughter.' Cordova, 47, an associate of De La Cruz, picked Myers up from her father's house, a police affidavit stated. Myers was an avid Facebook user and last logged onto the site on December 19. Investigators believe she died sometime that day. Her IP address was traced to the Country Inn and Suites Hotel in West Valley City. De La Cruz had checked into the hotel the day Myers is believed to have died, police say. Myers was an avid Facebook user and last logged onto the site on December 19. Investigators believe she died sometime that day. Her IP address was traced to the Country Inn and Suites Hotel . An informant told police Myers' body was placed in a black suitcase with a 'hard shell' and that he got into a car with Cordova and the suitcase, according to The Deseret News. He said there was a 'foul odor coming from within'. They then drove to Cactus Park and disposed of the suitcase, the affidavit states. On February 23, detectives met with the head housekeeper of the Country Inn & Suites. She described 'smelling a very strong and pungent smell' coming from the room De La Cruz had rented in December. The housekeeper added that it smelled 'as if someone did not wash their feet or socks for several months', the affidavit states. Cordova remained in the Mesa County Jail for investigation of drug-related charges. Myers  had numerous alleged drug arrests related to methamphetamine and police initially believed she had fled Colorado for Utah. Police also believed she may have tried to hitchhike to Salt Lake City. A search team was not sent out for the teenager until January 19. 'Investigators believe she has friends or known associates in the Salt Lake City area, and may have been trying to get there,' police said in a statement at the time.

Lamis Khamis, 42, was behind the wheel of her black 2.0 litre Audi when she got into a row with a man riding an electric-powered bicycle at a roundabout near Shepherd's Bush Green, in London. After the man kicked her car, Khamis followed him and drove her car into him at low speed, knocking him off his bike. Fashion designer to the stars Lamis Khamis has been fined £600 after she followed a cyclist in her car and deliberately knocked him over after the pair had argued and he kicked her Audi on a London roundabout . Khamis was fined £600 after a judge ruled that on her part 'it should not be described as road rage', but added that the cyclist could have been injured. The designer launched her own brand in 2001 after she graduated from Camberwell College of Arts. She set up a stall to sell her wares in Portobello Market in London and has since then attracted the attention of model Cara Delevingne, who has been pictured wearing her designs, Paris Hilton and musician Chris Brown. At a hearing at Isleworth Crown Court Khamis pleaded guilty to driving without due care and attention and a valid MOT on May 17. The fashion designer, who graduated from the Camberwell College of Arts, has worked with celebrities including Rita Ora (pictured) Model Cara Delevingne is pictured wearing a Lamis Khamis creation (left), while Katie Price worked with the designer in 2011 on fashion line Day 22, which she promoted on the Pure Spirit catwalk (right) The court heard that after the cyclist kicked the side of her car as they argued at the roundabout he made a dent, costing around £300 to repair. Recorder John Gallagher said: 'He rode off, but because his cycle had no registration plate you followed in an attempt to obtain details from him. 'You, in an attempt to stop him, drove into him and he fell off his cycle. Your actions were deliberate, but it was not a case of running a person down because you were only travelling at 10mph and he sustained no injuries. Lamis Khamis is pictured with Paris Hilton (centre), who is a fan of her designs and Sam Pemberton (left) 'However, this was a deliberate act and he might well have been injured and you did not consider the risks and alternatives.' Mr Gallagher also gave Khamis six penalty points on her licence. But he added: 'You are a mature lady who has never been in trouble with the police in the past and you have a clean driving licence and in twenty years have had no disqualifications.' The court heard that the prosecution had previously dropped a more serious charge of dangerous driving. Khamis pleaded guilty to driving without due care and attention and was fined, after the judge ruled the incident was not one of road rage, but that the victim could have been injured in the incident .","Lamis Khamis was driving in Shepherd's Bush when she got into an argument with a man on an electric bicycle who kicked her black Audi .

He is currently in the emergency department of Armadale Hospital awaiting a mental health assessment and remains in a stable condition. Cousins was reportedly arrested after driving erratically and was caught breaking into a Sikh temple to compulsively take photos before climbing onto the roof of another home in Canning Vale in Perth's south, according to Fairfax Media.

'I called the police and then I followed him again and he stopped his car in the middle of the road and then some cars almost hit him.' Mr Singh then became alarmed by the behaviour and left it to the police. 'He was not looking stable.' Before they arrived however, Cousins had moved onto another person's house and opened the door before realising Mr and Mrs. Singh were still watching him from their yard. He allegedly jumped fences and scaled a two-story home and paced along the roof. The police arrived ten minutes later and talked Cousins off the room before arresting him in Shreeve Road at 11am. CCTV has shown Cousins attempting to flee from police. 'I was pretty panicked - I locked the doors and we stayed inside in one of the bedrooms until I could get confirmation from police that it (the arrest) was done,' Witness Jenny Wilson told Network Ten. Ben Cousins, in 2007, after he was charged with drug possession and refusing a drug test . Cousins, who returned to the AFL with Richmond after the league banned him for one year, saw the latter stages of his career overshadowed by controversy . On March 16 Cousins, who has a history of serious drug abuse, was assessed at a mental health facility after he was caught behind the secure fences of an SAS base. The premiership star and former West Coast Eagles captain was apprehended at the Campbell Barracks near Perth at 11pm, according to Nine News. He was later assessed in the mental health ward at Sir Charles Gairdner Hospital where he was reportedly being held under 'mental health watch'. The 36-year-old was moved out of the hospital on the afternoon of March 16 but doctors remain concerned about his mental health, Seven News reports. Cousins was arrested the week prior for allegedly driving erratically and not stopping when requested by police. He is scheduled to face the Fremantle Magistrates Court on April 8. Cousins retired from the sport in 2010. He appeared in court in 2012 after being charged with drug possession . Cousins, 36, was arrested last week after allegedly being caught driving recklessly and failing to give a breath test. He is scheduled to face the Fremantle Magistrates Court on April 8 . The Brownlow Medalist's off-field antics have created headlines for almost a decade, due to well-publicised troubles with drugs and criminal connections. In 2005, Cousins and teammate Michael Gardiner became embroiled in police investigation into a nightclub shooting. The following year he was charged after abandoning his car and running away from police to avoid a booze bus. He entered rehab for 'substance abuse' in 2007, being later being suspended by the AFL for bringing the game into disrepute. Cousins returned to the game with Richmond in 2009, before he retired at the end of the 2010 season. In 2012, the then-retired star was charged with possession of methylamphetamine with intent to sell or supply by police located near a drug rehabilitation centre he was attending.

c66e49d676589e081b4f8af825875474f707e0e1,"A Silicon Valley venture capital firm has emerged victorious from a three-year high profile case accusing executives of gender discrimination. Reddit interim CEO Ellen Pao, 45, sued her former employer Kleiner Perkins Caufield & Byers for four counts of discrimination after she was fired. In a case that prompted a broad discussion about gender bias in the tech industry, Pao painted the firm as sexist, crude, and quarrelsome. On Friday, a jury of six men and six women rejected every claim after less than 72 hours of deliberation in San Francisco Superior Court. Scroll down for video . Lost: Ellen Pao (pictured after the verdict) sued her former employers for four counts of gender bias after she was fired. The Reddit CEO claimed her career crumbled at Kleiner after ending an affair with a partner . A jury of six men and six women rejected all of Pao's claims in San Francisco Superior Court on Friday . Over the course of three years, Pao told the court her career at the Silicon Valley firm crumbled after she ended a brief affair with partner Ajit Nazre, and was fired in 2012 when she complained. Pao, who is married to Wall Street financier Alphonse Fletcher Jr, said he 'falsely told her that his wife had left him' and 'engaged in offensive, obstructionist, and difficult behavior' until she 'succumbed' two or three times. After she ended the liaison, he started to 'retaliate', she claimed. At one point, she said, Nazre appeared at her colleague's hotel room on a business trip wearing nothing but a bathrobe, carrying a glass of wine, according to testimony. The court heard Ray Lane, a former partner, said the woman, Trae Vassallo, should have been 'flattered'. Kleiner countered that it investigated Nazre after Vassallo complained, after which he quickly left the firm. Pao's first claim, tabled in 2007, also accused senior partner Randy Komisar of giving her a Leonard Cohen book, Book Of Longing, filled with sexually explicit drawings and poems. Later, he asked her to dinner adding that 'his wife would be out of town'. The case played out as Silicon Valley saw a steady decline in the number of female venture capitalists. Recent figures collected by Babson College show six per cent of the venture capital is female, down from 10 per cent in 1999. With that backdrop, Pao's lawyers described Kleiner as a pressure cooker that was hostile toward women. One of Pao's mentors testified that subpar performance meant she was not promoted, rather than gender . The firm disputed those charges, presenting evidence that Kleiner went out of its way to hire women. During the case, the court heard one partner, Chi-Hua Chien, said women 'kill the buzz' as he argued only men should be invited to a dinner with Al Gore. John Doerr, once Pao's direct boss, told investigators she had 'a female chip on her shoulder'. And senior partner Ted Schlein rebuffed the feminist rallying call from Facebook's COO Sheryl Sandberg that women 'deserve a seat at the table'. He said: 'I really don’t think it was a very big deal to us who sits at a table or who does not.' Specifically, Pao alleged that: . The jury ruled against Pao on the first three claims but was sent back to deliberate the fourth due to an apparent miscount. Two hours later, they emerged in favor of Kleiner Perkins. The court requires a minimum of 9-3 votes to come to a conclusion. But initially, the verdict stated that four jurors supported Pao's view that she was fired because she sued for gender discrimination. On the pivotal claim that Pao was fired for being female, ten jurors ruled gender was not a substantial factor. They came to their conclusion after completing this question-and-answer document. According to Wall Street Journal reporter Jeff Elder, Pao looked down and forced a smile as the judge revealed she had lost. Some witnesses, including Pao's onetime mentor John Doerr, testified that Pao's lack of advancement stemmed from subpar performance, not discrimination or retaliation. However, Pao's attorneys argued she played a pivotal role in the investment in RPX and Twitter. Pao testified for five days and faced questions from jurors such as whether it was 'professional to enter into an affair with a married partner?' 'Going back I would not have done it again, but I didn't think it was inappropriate at the time,' Pao said. Following the verdict on Friday, Pao released a statement via Twitter. In nine tweets, she wrote: 'Thank you, world. 'I have been inspired by the thousands of people who have reached out to me over the past three years with support. 'I’ve heard from people in Kazakhstan, Bangladesh, Australia, Malaysia, France, Argentina, Norway, Tanzania, Finland, and beyond. 'Because of social media and live reports, the problem of gender discrimination in venture capital has received attention around the globe . 'While today’s outcome is a disappointment, I take consolation in knowing that people really listened . 'If we do not share our stories and shine a light on inequities, things will not change . 'Hopefully my case will inspire the venture capital industry to level the playing field for everyone, including women and minorities . 'To support the entrepreneurs of tomorrow, we need to show leadership today.

""He is in the bed right this moment, but looking forward to come back home,"" Carter said during a speech at a Nobel Peace Prize Forum in Minneapolis. ""He said tell everybody he is doing well."" Mondale underwent treatment at the Mayo Clinic in Rochester, Minnesota. The 42nd vice president served under Carter between 1977 and 1981, and later ran for President, but lost to Ronald Reagan.

e2c0cb3ed7d83a68b46de8c843dd6306a0e030cd,"It would be lovely to think that Nick Cruwys will wake up soon to be told of the compassion and humility shown by a growing army of football supporters. At the time of writing he is in a coma, fighting for his life after being ambushed by a group of Wolverhampton Wanderers fans as he made his way to the railway station after Watford's 2-2 draw at Molineux on Saturday. A group of Wolves supporters were so ashamed of the incident that they set up a website, a page dedicated to raising money to pay for Cruwys's travel and tickets to future matches. Watford fan Nick Cruwys (left) is currently in a coma after being ambushed by a group of Wolves fans as he made his way to the station following the 2-2 draw in the Championship fixture (right) at Molineux on Saturday . Over £22,000 has been raised for Nick Cruwys via a football fund set up by group of  Wolves supporters . Watford fan Nick Cruwys lies on the ground as he is attacked following his side's draw with Wolves . Cruwys is currently in an induced coma and fighting for his life in hospital . Cruwys was heading to Wolverhampton train station when he was subjected to an 'unprovoked attack' The initial target was £1,000 but by Tuesday evening 1,672 people had raised £22,089. Football can respond in the most remarkable ways, but these supporters know that society's fragile truce with the game ended when this vicious and unprovoked attack took place. We have a tendency to move on so quickly, to switch on the television set, to sit down to watch Liverpool against Blackburn and then look forward to a mouth-watering FA Cup tie between Manchester United and Arsenal. It is natural. Always looking forward, leaving the bad bits of the weekend behind and hoping for a better result for our team on Saturday. Nothing wrong with that, nothing at all. But sometimes we must pause for thought, to return to the scene of the crime for a few salutary moments and think about this poor guy in a hospital bed, fighting for his life. To wonder what it must be like for a family member to receive a call from the police telling them that their husband, their dad, their son, is lying in a hospital, in a coma, may never wake up. Cruwys was making his way to the train station after the 2-2 draw between the sides at Molineux (pictured) Troy Deeney (left) stretches out top convert the equaliser  for Watford who took a point in a 2-2 draw . Deeney celebrates after his goal prevented rivals Wolves from taking all three points in the promotion race . Or to consider his friends, the people who witnessed this horrific attack as they made their way through that intimidating underpass near the stadium and headed for the railway station. Or the innocent bystanders, the people who are frozen in time when these injudicious attacks take place. They, too, will be traumatised. Then there are the perpetrators, the thugs who are responsible for this attack. Are they proud men today, or hiding like cowards? Cruwys is a football fan like me or you, following his team - Watford, in this case - around the country on a Saturday afternoon. There is a rising tide in the sport, the 'Who-Wants-Some?' culture creating waves again after more raw footage emerged from Villa Park last weekend. What is the motivation for this? Please don't say a 5.30pm kick-off meaning lads full of ale, because that is no excuse either. We cannot put a news value on someone's existence either, just because the team Cruwys follows do not play to the bells and whistles of the Barclays Premier League each weekend. This is someone's life and we have a moral obligation to address these perplexing issues. Aston Villa fans storm on to the Villa Park pitch after their 2-0 win against West Bromwich Albion in the FA Cup . The 5.30pm kick-off in the West Midlands derby on Saturday was no excuse for the behaviour of the fans . West Midlands Police are making some progress in the hunt for the thugs who did this and an appeal for witnesses was retweeted 82 times over the past few days. There is a desire to do more, to create an environment where tribal passion is not overwhelmed by people, however small their number, throwing punches, even in isolated incidents. For Cruwys and his friends, who were among the 2,239 Watford supporters who made the trip to Wolves, the game was a real nail-biter. Leaving the ground they would have been pleased to get a point. The Watford great Kenny Jackett, a long-serving player and former manager at Vicarage Road, is now manager of Wolves. He remains a popular figure with their fans. Towards the end of a riveting 2-2 draw, Wolves defender Bakary Sako was sent off when Watford substitute Fernando Forestieri went down clutching his face. That incident is not to be interpreted as a causal link because nothing that happened on a football pitch can ever justify what happened next. Wolves boss Kenny Jackett is a former Watford player and manager and remains a popular figure with fans . Bakary Sako was sent off after Fernando Forestieri went down clutching his face following an altercation . To think Cruwys's day ended with his family being informed that he is in a coma takes us into unforgiving territory. This is the unacceptable face of the game, a severe reminder that the sport must meet the needs of the supporters inside and outside stadiums. According to Home Office statistics there were only 2,273 football-related arrests last year, which includes all four divisions, plus European competitions and internationals. It is the lowest since records began. Last season 33 million people attended matches and less than 0.01 per cent of those in attendance were arrested. The numbers look good on paper, but the Home Office also makes it clear that the police do not always have the manpower to make arrests. If 5,000 fans stormed the pitch at Villa Park - theoretically every one of them should be arrested and banned . Fans charge towards Scott Sinclair and his team-mates after his goal against West Brom on Saturday . For example, let's say around 5,000 Villa supporters invaded the pitch at the end of their 2-0 victory over West Brom in the FA Cup quarter-final on Saturday. Theoretically, every one of them could be arrested and banned from Villa Park for life. It will never happen, which is why those Home Office statistics can easily be distorted. There is certainly some grim reading in the West Midlands at the moment, with the police force making further appeals on Monday to jog the memory of anyone who witnessed the incident in Wolverhampton. Wrong place, wrong time? Don't give me that.

'I hope you make better decisions in your presidency than you did about Georgia State!' coach Ron Hunter said after the game in a Vine video. The White House wouldn't apologize on Friday for Obama's incorrect assumption that the Baylor Bears, a 3-seed in the tournament, would prevail against the Georgia State Panthers. The president's spokesman did say, however that the young man who scored the winning basket 'certainly rose to the occasion.' Scroll down for video . RJ Hunter (left, with basketball) made a last-minute three-pointer to send his Georgia State Panthers to the next round of the NCAA Tournament . RJ's father Ron (center) , Georgia State's coach, fell off of his rolling chair, which he was forced to sit on after tearing his Achilles tendon on Sunday . The elder hunter was helped up from the floor by assistants after the stunning shot sank in, leading the 14-seed to upset 3-seed Baylor . Coach Hunter drew nationwide attention after he toppled off of the stool from which he had been cheering on his team after son RJ hit a deep three-pointer, putting the Panthers up 57-56 with 2.7 seconds remaining. Baylor had been favorited in the game by 9. With the younger Hunter on fire, scoring 16 points, Georgia State claimed victory in the final seconds of the game. The Panthers had been down by 12 with less than three minutes left before surging back for a stunning comeback and winning on the junior guard, according to ESPN. Remarking on the surprising come-from-behind win on Friday, White House Press Secretary Josh Earnest said, ''That was a great shot there at the end of the game.' 'I think there’s no question that...that kind of high- level performance when the chips are down is certainly the kind of...spirit that the president would hope to summon in the context of his job, too,' he added. Georgia State, in the NCAA tournament for the first time since 2001, was picked by few to advance to the second round. President Barack Obama had Baylor winning the game in his bracket. 'I hope you make better decisions in your presidency than you did about Georgia State!' coach Hunter said after the game, teassing the president . Coach Hunter's assistants had to help him get back into his chair after he was literally floored by his son's last minute heroics. He had been perched on the rolling chair to reduce the strain of a Achilles tendon injury he incurred while celebrating the team's Sun Belt victory over Georgia Southern. The proud father, 50, was wearing a cast and often tried to stand up before being restrained by other coaches during the game. Georgia State will play No. 6 team Xavier in the next round of the NCAA tournament's West division of this year's bracket. Their victory was the second 3-seed upset of the day, coming after UAB's one-point win over Iowa State, favored by 14 points.

980e9f43ec7c6c31ab340bec30f63852e523d889,"An exodus of GPs leaving to work abroad or take early retirement means surgeries across England are in crisis, experts warned last night. The number of family doctors applying to work in Australia, Canada and other countries where they can earn more for fewer hours has jumped by 40 per cent in just five years. And around 22,400 GPs – more than half of England’s 40,200 family doctors – want to retire before the usual age of 60, separate figures show. Lured away: Online ads promises British doctors ‘more money’ and ‘great earning potential’ if they leave Britain for Australia (file image) Health Secretary Jeremy Hunt described the situation as worrying and promised to make ‘important changes’ to the NHS to ease the pressure on GPs. Some surgeries in Cumbria are so desperate for staff they are paying locum GPs £850 a day to stand in, a new BBC Inside Out documentary has discovered. It follows the Mail’s revelation last week how one practice, in Swinton, South Yorkshire, was making patients wait four weeks for an appointment. Krishna Kasaraneni, a GP at the Crown Street Surgery, told Inside Out that three of its doctors had moved to Australia and Canada since last summer due to ‘unsustainable daily pressure’. The programme, being broadcast tonight, also obtained figures from the General Medical Council that revealed 792 GPs were given ‘Certificates of Good Standing’ last year to allow them to practise abroad. This compares to 576 in 2008 and 562 in 2009. Crisis: Some surgeries in Cumbria are so desperate for staff they are paying locum GPs £850 a day to stand in, a new BBC Inside Out documentary has discovered (file photo) The NHS is currently advertising in medical magazines in Australia to try to lure back British doctors, promising a ‘fully funded induction and returner scheme’. On top of the exodus to foreign climes, 56 per cent of GPs ‘definitely’ or ‘probably’ expect to leave the profession before their 60th birthday, according to a survey of 1,004 family doctors carried out by Inside Out. Dr David Jones, 46, who formerly practised in Manchester, moved to Perth, Western Australia, over a year ago. He said: ‘We arrived in November 2013. It’s wonderful here. We do 45 hours a week and weekends are off to enjoy the sunshine. I’m very, very proud of what my colleagues at home do. They do an incredibly difficult job. They get assaulted from all sides. ‘I do feel guilty to some extent. When a government invests so much money in a profession you are a national asset to that country. But the way that asset is being treated in that country, it’s just pushing people away. It’s reached a point where people are just saying no, I’m not doing this any more. ‘We shouldn’t be here. Had our profession been looked after as it should have been we wouldn’t think about leaving.’ The website GP Jobs in Australia promises British doctors ‘more money’ and ‘great earning potential’. It adds: ‘Typical earnings start from £145,000 and rise to £195,000 per annum after a few years’ experience.’ But it says doctors working in rural locations can earn ‘considerably more’, adding: ‘Compared to the NHS, there’s less hassle, less bureaucracy, more medicine and money.’ Younger doctors are not plugging the gaps, with up to one in eight GP training posts unfilled. They are instead choosing the more attractive career paths as hospital specialists or surgeons. The situation has become so dire that 1,063 GPs are needed just to return to the patient-to-doctor ratio of 2009, according to separate figures released by the House of Commons Library. Under the previous Labour government, GPs benefited hugely by a new contract that saw average salaries soar to £105,000 a year and enabled GPs to opt out of evening and weekend work. But many doctors now say they are dismayed by the volume of paperwork, the demands of the ageing population and the insufficient funds given to surgeries by the Government. Mr Hunt said yesterday: ‘What I hope GPs recognise is the things they’ve said to us are worrying them are being addressed. 'They said they didn’t like the targets they have, what are called the QOF targets, and we’ve reduced those by 40 per cent. ‘They said they needed more money to invest in their premises and we put in this extra money in the Autumn Statement. ‘These things don’t happen overnight so I would urge people to bear with us while we make these really important changes. Shadow health secretary Andy Burnham said: ‘David Cameron promised to put GPs at the heart of the NHS – but instead caused a new GP recruitment crisis. It is getting harder and harder to get a GP appointment as a result.’","Online ads promises British GPs more money for less hours in Australia .

Ken Gregory, 65, suffered first and second degree burns to 14% of his body after the assault at his £295,000 bungalow in Peterborough in March last year. A year on, pictures of his injuries show painful blistering stretching from his scalp to his lower back - and some of the scars will never fade. Scroll down for video . Ken Gregory was left horrifically scarred after his now ex-wife threw boiling water over him   in March last year . Mr Gregory met Teresa Gilbertson (pictured together) through ballroom dancing, but they relationship became sour after five years of marriage . His ex-wife Teresa Gilbertson, 60, is awaiting sentencing after being convicted of grievous bodily harm with intent following the attack. Mr Gregory has decided to speak out because he believes it is important to challenge the stigma surrounding men who are victims of abuse. Retired BT manager Mr Gregory said: 'Being attacked by a woman is nothing to be ashamed of.' 'I had never imagined something like this would happen to me. 'As a man who is a bit older and who isn't exactly small, there is a perception that you can't be a victim of domestic violence. 'I was worried that people would assume that it was my fault and she was the victim - there is still a general perception that, as a strong man against a weaker female, you must have been the protagonist. A year on, the retired BT manager is speaking out to challenge the stigma surrounding men who are victims of abuse. Pictured, Mr Gregory with the jug his ex-wife used . Mr Gregory's ex-wife Teresa Gilbertson, 60, is awaiting sentencing after being convicted of grievous bodily harm with intent following the attack. Pictured, injuries to his back (left) and shoulder (right) 'But it should be the same message that they put out for women many years ago: don't be frightened, you don't have to put up with it.' The couple met through ballroom dancing following the death of Mr Gregory's first wife   of more than 30 years, Maureen, seven years ago. But after five years of marriage, their relationship soured. On the day of the attack on March 23, Mr Gregory had been due to take flowers to his late wife's memorial to mark her birthday.  Instead the couple rowed over finances and household chores. Eventually, they reached an apparently mutual  decision to get a divorce and Gilbertson had offered to make a cup of tea. Mr Gregory, who has limited mobility due to arthritis, turned down the offer, but his wife left the room and returned with a jug of freshly boiled water. Peterborough Crown Court heard she told him 'there you go' after tipping it over his head without warning. It was the culmination of escalating verbal abuse. Three weeks earlier, Mr Gregory needed hospital treatment after Gilbertson threw a cup of tea over him while he slept, in what she claimed was an accident. When police arrived following the final incident, Mr Gregory said she told officers: 'If I'd wanted to kill him, I'd have used a knife.' Reliving the incident, Mr Gregory said: 'I was sitting with my back to her and it came without warning. 'It was unbearable, searing pain - I'd never known anything like it. 'Afterwards I could barely sleep as I couldn't lie on my back.' Mr Gregory, who has limited mobility due to arthritis, said the injuries meant he barely sleep after the attack . Experts told the trial that the pattern of the injuries showed the water must have been poured deliberately - and not by accident. Mr Gregory said: 'From the start, the police took it very seriously and even our mutual friends were able to see that I was the innocent party. 'If other men find themselves in this position, I would say don't be embarrassed or ashamed - my case goes to show that this can happen to anybody.' Detective Inspector Mark Woolner, from Cambridgeshire Police's domestic abuse unit, said the force has specially-trained officers who support both male and female victims of domestic violence. He said:  'Men affected by domestic abuse often feel that they won't be taken seriously, but this simply isn't the case.' Gilbertson will be sentenced on March 24 after being found guilty earlier this month.","Ken Gregory suffered first and second degree burns to 14% of his body .

Paul Bell, a director of 666Bet, was reportedly arrested at Heathrow airport last week as part of a joint money-laundering investigation by HM Revenue & Customs and the National Crime Agency. Six other people were arrested, 13 properties were raided and £1m in cash was also seized as part of the investigation.

It also signed former QPR manager Redknapp to appear in its adverts, alongside Lock, Stock and Two Smoking Barrels actor Vas Blackwood. Last week, the UK gambling regulator The Gambling Commission suspended the firm's licence. The suspension led to Football League One side Leyton Orient, which signed a contract with the bookmakers in August last year, terminating its deal for shirt sponsorship.

Arsenal and United have had plenty of heated battles with Wenger referencing the infamous 'Battle of Old Trafford' incident as the one that stands out. Speaking to Sportsmail columnist Keown on BBC Radio 5 Live, Wenger recalled the defender's confrontation with Van Nistelrooy following the United striker's  penalty miss in September 2003. Martin Keown confronts Ruud van Nistelrooy following the United striker's missed penalty in September 2003 . Keown screams at Van Nistelrooy following his last-minute spot kick miss during the 'Battle of Old Trafford' Arsene Wenger told Keown that the incident was his most memorable from Arsenal's encounters with  United . 'The most memorable? You were involved in it,' Wenger said jokingly to Keown. 'Of course that famous incident with the penalty with Van Nistelrooy.' As Arsenal gear up for their FA Cup sixth round tie against Manchester United next Monday, Wenger insists he is as hungry as ever for success. Arsenal and United have enjoyed an intense rivalry in the cup down the years and are only separated by a point in the Barclays Premier League. Ahead of Monday's clash, Wenger admitted he didn't know where his FA Cup medals from previous successes were. 'Medals, I don't even know where there are,' said Wenger. 'That tells you that I don't look back. The human side of the game is more important to me as opposed to the medals. 'I prefer a box of memories. In this job, you have a big influence in people's lives, they have a big influence in your life as well. 'At the top top level, these are special people - that remains longer with you than the medal, it's not the only thing that matters. 'You want to think you can have a positive influence on people lives, the club and the style of play.' Arsenal manager Arsene Wenger oversees training at the club's base in Colney on Monday . Wenger will attempt to outwit United manager Louis van Gaal, who has been criticised recently, but the Frenchman reserved special praise for the Dutchman. 'I think he's a great manager,' said Wenger. 'If you look at what he's done in his career, its incredible. He's stabilised the club. They've only lost two in 18 games. The job is more demanding now. Every game now is a trial where you judged before and after.' Arsenal's intense rivalry with United was defined for years by Wenger's clashes with Sir Alex Ferguson. 'I'm much happier to see him now than before,' Wenger added. 'In the end, it became more peaceful and respectful. He was not always objective defending his time, nor was I. 'Today, we are happy to have a good dinner or good glass of wine and just talk about football.'

The 51-year-old former European middleweight champion has started chemotherapy, walking to a hospital near his south London home for each session to keep fit. The determined former boxer, who has never smoked, vowed that he would conquer cancer. Boxing champion Errol Christie (left) has revealed he is battling lung cancer in what he says is the toughest fight of his life . He told the Sunday People: 'I am just starting my treatment. I've had my first round of chemo and it has really been tough but I am going to beat this.' Christie's son Louie, 26, said that his father had been unwell for a while but was only recently diagnosed with lung cancer. Louie, who is also a boxer, said: 'It is a real shock because my dad has always been fit and has never smoked or drunk – it seems so unfair. 'Being who he is, he didn’t want to make a fuss when he felt unwell. He thought it would clear up. 'It was a real shock when he got the results back. We were both stunned. But he is ­remaining positive and has vowed to beat it. He is determined to get well. I’m very proud of how he is coping.' Christie, pictured during his memorable bout with Mark Kaylor (right) in 1985, has started chemotherapy . Explosive: Christie (right) and Kaylor got up close and personal while promoting their clash in 1985 . Christie was training amateur boxers, including X Factor host Dermot O'Leary, at Gym Box in London until last week but has been forced to put that on hold to focus on fighting his illness. Christie's son was due to make his boxing debut as a featherweight next month but this has now been put on hold because of his father's diagnosis. During his boxing career, the former champion fought 41 bouts, taking 32 wins including 26 by knockout. He suffered eight defeats, most memorably to Mark Kaylor in 1985. The infamous match was preceded by an ugly scuffle at the pre-fight conference, and when the boxing finally got underway Christie lost in nine rounds in a match where both men were floored. Although he boxed on into the early 90s, he was never the same fighter again and hung up his gloves in 1993. Christie's greatest success came in 1982 when he defeated Mow Gruciano in what was then East Germany to take the European middleweight belt. The father-of-one was involved in a scuffle with fellow former boxer Lloyd Honeyghan last October during a Boxing Writer's Club dinner at the Savoy Hotel in London. Frank Bruno had to step in to separate the pair after they squared up, but no punches were thrown. Christie said at the time: 'There was a bit of an incident with Lloyd. I don't know what planet he was on but it's different from the rest of us. No punches were thrown. He was just mouthing off, acting the big shot.'","Errol Christie has revealed that he has been diagnosed with lung cancer .

Embarrassed waiters apologised and handed over the £7.25 but when pest control examined the creature they found it had the appearance of a domestic pet, and had recently 'had a haircut'. This is the moment diner Christopher Baker, 28, (pictured left) tried to get out of paying for his £7.25 Valentine's Day buffet meal for one by releasing his pet rat into the restaurant . Baker (left) admitted fraud by false representation, and was ordered to pay the restaurant the £7.25 back in compensation, but angry owner Kevin Smith (right) says Baker has caused him 'nothing but grief' Baker ordered the meal from the Borneo Bistro in Sunderland (pictured) and sat down to eat alone, before pulling the pet rodent from his pocket, releasing it onto the floor and demanding a refund . The pet rat released into the restaurant. Pest controllers said it appeared to be tame, and had recently had its fur trimmed . Bistro owner Kevin Smith then checked the restaurant's CCTV and spotted Baker producing the rat and putting it on the floor. Baker, of Houghton, Sunderland later admitted fraud by false representation, and was ordered to pay the restaurant the £7.25 back in compensation, as well as a £60 victim surcharge. 'On February 14 - Valentine's Day - Mr Baker has attended the restaurant, ordered a buffet for one and a bottle of water,' Lee Poppett, prosecuting, told Sunderland Magistrates' Court. 'He picked his food up and found a seat at a table on his own at the back of the restaurant. 'At shortly before 4pm he suddenly jumps up and shouts 'It's a rat. I'm not eating here, I want my money back'. 'Mr Smith perhaps smelled a rat at this particular point and he retrieved the rat from the floor.

The footage shows Baker get money out of his pocket - then appear to change his mind and get the rat out . Baker retrieved the rat from his pocket as a family sitting nearby moved away from their table . 'He waited until a family moved from the table next to him and retrieved what appeared to be a rat from his pocket and dropped it on the floor. He then jumped out of his seat. 'He then claimed that whilst he's been eating, the rat has bitten his finger. He asked for his money back. 'It was a black and white rat, very calm. It did not appear to be wild at all. Acorn Pest Control attended and they said it appeared to be a pet. 'Mr Smith viewed the CCTV and saw the defendant fiddling in his pocket.' Baker then puts the rat on the floor and leaps out of his chair to the astonishment of fellow diners . The court was told that Baker had claimed that as he ate, the rat bit him on the finger . Baker was seen jumping up and shouting: 'It's a rat.

He then puts it on the floor and leaps out of his chair and backs away to the astonishment of fellow diners. They then see the rat and jump up themselves and most head towards the door of the bistro looking horrified. Within minutes every customer is on their feet while staff try and catch Baker's pet. Baker was later arrested and told police that he had bought the rat from a pet shop as a gift for his daughter, before placing it in his pocket and heading to the restaurant. Willie Johnstone, defending, said: 'We do deal with some unusual cases from time to time. 'Christopher, on that day, had been drinking heavily and unfortunately he decided to buy a rat for his daughter by way of a present. A fellow customer points out the rat to a member of restaurant staff inside the bistro . 'Unfortunately, he then decided to go for a meal. He sat down and ate his meal. When he had finished the meal, he took the rat out. He is very remorseful for his behaviour.' In a victim statement read out in court, Mr Smith said the potential damage to his business's reputation could have been 'catastrophic', and that Baker could have ruined the future of the restaurant that he had spent seven years building up. As well as being ordered to pay the victim surcharge and compensation, Baker was sentenced to a 12-month community order with supervision. He was also banned from going to the restaurant for a year. Chairman of the bench, Derek Moss, said: 'This is a very serious matter as what you have done here could in a split-second have ruined this man's business, which he has worked for years to build up a reputation for.' Speaking after the case, Mr Smith branded Baker 'scum', and said he deserved to be punished. The 47-year-old said: 'He is just the scum of the earth. He could have destroyed the reputation I have built up over seven years. 'I was devastated. I thought 'that's it my business is gone'. I didn't sleep that night. 'People like him deserve the death penalty.' 'As far as I'm concerned, he shouldn't be in our society. He is no use to anybody and he's caused nothing but grief.

This stunning weather map shows how those in the west of the country enjoyed one of the warmest February's on record, while those in the east endured heavy snowfall and freezing temperatures. The extreme contrast in temperatures has been put down to global warming and the melting sea ice in the Arctic by some experts, according to NASA's Earth Observatory. The satellite image produced by NASA records the land surface temperature. The places that experience below average conditions are coloured blue, normal appear white and those in red were warmer than average . The map has been produced using data from NASA's Terra satellite and shows how temperatures this February compared with those over the last ten years.. The satellite recorded the land surface temperature and the map  shows a clear divide  right down the middle of the country. The areas that experienced cooler than average conditions are coloured in blue, normal appear white, and those in red were warmer than average. The mercury soared some 10 degrees approve than average in the western half and those in the east saw temperatures 10 degrees below average. Statewide data showed that no state experienced record cold temperatures in February, but many cities broke their own records, according to Live Science. In New York a new low of minus 13 degrees was set, beating its old record by 1.6 degrees. Last month huge ice sheets formed on the surface of New York's Hudson River forcing the US Coastguard to deploy ice breakers in order to keep shipping and ferry traffic moving. Ferry operators in the city described it as the worst winter they had experienced in more than 28 years. A huge ice volcano also appeared in a New York Park. Records were also broken in the likes of Worcester and Massachusetts. In contrast record highs were set in the likes of Washington, Nevada, and California during February, according to the website. California is in the midst of a three year drought that has been caused by a combination of record high temperatures and sparse rainfall. This has produced the worst conditions in 1,200 years, according to a study. Experts predict it will take about 11 trillion gallons of water (42 cubic kilometers) -- around 1.5 times the maximum volume of the largest U.S. reservoir - for California to recover.

The dry bed of the Stevens Creek Reservoir in California: A combination of record high temperatures and sparse rainfall during California'sthree-year drought have produced the worst conditions in 1,200 years . Researchers were reportedly exploring a number of possible causes behind the contrasting weather patterns seen across the US last. NASA's Earth Observatory said: 'Most meteorologists attribute the sharply contrasting temperatures to the combination of a persistent ridge of high pressure—nicknamed the “Ridiculously Resilient Ridge”—over the northeastern Pacific Ocean, and an equally persistent trough that has funneled chilly air from the Arctic into central North America. 'But why that resilient ridge has appeared over the northeastern Pacific during the last few winters is a more complicated and controversial question among experts. 'A new line of research suggests that the loss of Arctic sea ice associated with global warming may be causing the jet stream to slow down and become wavier, thus setting up the unusual pattern over North America. 'Other researchers think there could be a link between Siberian snowfall and mid-latitude weather extremes. 'Still others think changes in the Arctic have little to do with mid-latitude weather extremes; instead they see periods with an anomalously sharp gradient in sea surface temperature in the far western Pacific as the key factor. All participants looking at the question agree: more research is needed.'","Weather map produced using data from NASA's Terra Satellite that measures land surface temperature .

She paired her Preen dress with some simple black pumps and stayed jewelry and accessory free. Her swept back pompadour-inspired hair mimicked her youthful and effortless elegance. The overall effect was decidedly grown up and dressy, but with a laid back insouciant vibe.

17e14ffdecaa9bf007bf7cb130b503c36a49347b,"Nigel Pearson has been caught on camera appearing to swear at a journalist after taking issue with a line of questioning. The Leicester City manager was picked up on microphone seeming to call the reporter a ‘p****’ under his breath as his press conference following the 0-0 draw with Hull City ended. Pearson was annoyed about a question over Steve Bruce’s claim Leicester’s players crowded referee Jon Moss in an attempt to get Alex Bruce sent off for a tackle on Riyad Mahrez. VIDEO: Scroll down to watch Nigel Pearson's outburst . Nigel Pearson fixes a reporter with a stare during a tetchy exchange after the draw with Hull . After concluding the press conference, Pearson muttered 'waxing away, my a***' under his breath . He was then further angered by the suggestion his team’s season was ‘waxing or waning’ with ten games left and seven points separating Leicester from safety. ‘Waxing or waning, f****** hell. My a***,’ Pearson is heard saying as he finishes his press conference at the King Power Stadium. As he gets up he appears to utter the word: ‘P****.’ Pearson was irked at his players being accused of intimidating the officials given his stance on such matters. Pearson does not countenance such dark arts. In a December interview he said: 'People who are more cynical-minded might say I’m naive. 'There is a concern at the Premier League about the number of times that is happening. I hope my players don’t start doing it. 'There’s a difference between being streetwise and using intimidation of officials as a vehicle to win. I’d never cheat to win.' He is fiercely protective of his squad and, in any case, replays showed only a couple put their arms up in appeal with the same number of Hull players arguing the opposite. The Leicester manager then seemed to call the journalist a 'p****' for the line of questioning . Pearson looks frustrated during another game where his Leicester side failed to win . It is a third controversial incident for Pearson this season. In December he was banned from the dugout for one game and fined £10,000 for telling a supporter to ‘f*** off and die’ after receiving sustained abuse. In February he was involved in a touchline exchange with James McArthur as the pair fell together. Pearson jokingly throtted the Crystal Palace midfielder then held onto his shirt as he attempted to rejoin play. The next day brought Pearson’s phantom sacking, when Leicester owner Vichai Srivaddhanaprabha is believed to have wanted to bring the axe before his son Aiyawatt counselled against. Bruce’s comments ultimately triggered the exchange on Saturday evening. The Hull manager said: ‘There is a raging debate about Chelsea in midweek. I’ve seen everybody surround Alex for a red card for his challenge. ‘For me it is a perfectly decent challenge I would expect a centre-half to make. The reason we enjoy the Premier League is its honesty and integrity and if we’re going to go down the route of every other league jumping around, whinging, trying to get people yellow cards and red cards. For me it’s not right.’ Pearson was asked if he thought it was a fair criticism. ‘No,’ he said, before entering into a tetchy exchange with the journalist which ended with him finishing the press conference in angry fashion, and swearing under his breath. Steve Bruce cited Chelsea in terms of the Leicester players behaved to try and get Alex Bruce sent off… . Did they? Oh very nice. Do you think that’s a fair criticism? No. What’s your take on that situation? I’ve just said no. But what’s your take on a situation where all the players surround a referee? How many times have you seen us play this year? Three times. Well there you are then. You’re not in a position to judge my players on that. I’m not judging anyone. I’m just asking you… . You’ve asked me and I’ve told you. No was the answer. I don’t think it’s a fair assessment. Full stop. Do you consider that Leicester’s season is waxing or waning? I don’t have to use that sort of analogy. We are in the same position. We’ve got ten games left, six games at home, and our home form has to be drastically improved for us to give ourselves the best chance. That’s it. You got any more questions you want to ask? Obviously not. Yep good thank you. Waxing or waning, f****** hell. My a***. P****. Pearson seems to be feeling the pressure as his side remain rooted to the bottom of the table .

FA technical director Dan Ashworth and England Under 21 manager Gareth Southgate want young England players to gain tournament experience. Their view has the backing of chairman Greg Dyke, leading to the FA changing their mind about sending only a women’s side — if any — to Brazil. The FA’s departing general secretary Alex Horne wrote to the other three countries on his last day in office at Wembley informing them that it was now their intention to enter both Olympic football competitions.

FA technical director Dan Ashworth, pictured talking to Roy Hodgson, shares the views of the Under 21 boss . Former Manchester united midfielder Ryan Giggs captained Team GB at the 2012 Olympics . However, the manner of the FA taking the lead on raising the teams infuriated Wales, especially, and Northern Ireland, leading to a stormy meeting between officials at the IFAB summit in Belfast last Friday. Scotland were less concerned because of their long, unequivocal opposition to the GB football format, which they see as a threat to their independence within FIFA. The main sensitivity with the Welsh and the Irish was why the FA had the divine right to be the national association with the football seat on the British Olympic Association since its inception in 1905. Wales are also upset about the FA reneging — owing to a rules change — on a gentlemen’s agreement over the rotation of the British vice-president seat on FIFA executive committee.

The rumpus has led to FIFA telling the FA to sort out the internal fighting before submitting their GB football applications. The men’s side would need to reach the last four of the European Under 21 Championship this summer to qualify. The Olympic issue has raised extra emotions because it follows all the fuss around the home nations providing players at London 2012 for a Team GB side that the BOA mandated England to select.

With the warmer months upon us the countdown is on for all manner of festivals around the globe, with many of them revolving around intriguing, entertaining and downright wacky events. MailOnline Travel sheds some light on the most unique sporting escapes you could take this year as a spectator or in some cases even as a participant, from the historic cheese-rolling race in Gloucestershire to the Mud Olympics in Brunsbuettel, Germany. Scroll down for video . The 20th annual Wife Carrying World Championships will be held on July 3 and 4 in Sonkajärvi, Finland . WIFE CARRYING WORLD CHAMPIONSHIPS: SONKAJARVI, FINLAND . While it doesn't exactly fly the flag for sexual equality, the annual Wife Carrying World Championships certainly appears to be a fun couple of days in Sonkajärvi, Finland. Since 1994 couples from around the world have converged on the town of about 4,000 people that without the event would be famous for having more than 200 lakes in the area. The 20th edition will be held this year over July 3 and 4 and be another carnival-like affair with, of course, the wife carrying as the main event but also including markets and a fiercely contested karaoke competition. In wife carrying, a man must carry a woman weighing at least 108lbs (if she is less than this she has to wear weights) around a 830ft sand track with tricky obstacles to contend with. While it sounds like a pub dare that's simply gone too far, the event has roots in the late 19th century when the leader of a local gang called Rosvo-Ronkainen tested potential recruits on a tough obstacle course - it wasn't uncommon for the men to steal women from nearby towns. A wheel of cheese speeds away from its chasers on the steep slope of Cooper's Hill near Brockworth . CHEESE-ROLLING RACE: BROCKWORTH, GLOUCESTERSHIRE . Every year a wheel of cheese is rolled down the steep slope of Cooper's Hill on the outskirts of the village of Brockworth and is followed by a bunch of people risking life and limb to catch it. Given the cheese can reach speeds of up to 70mph, the chase is a futile expedition but a spectacularly bizarre spectacle for onlookers who come from all over the world to compete or watch. The winner is the first to cross a line at the bottom. The local council wants nothing to do with the race, its most famous attraction, due to concerns over safety and insurance, but it goes on each year regardless. Injuries are inevitable in the race that has taken place since the 15th century on the Gloucestershire hill . While its origin is disputed, rolling down the hill after the cheese wheel dates back as far as the 15th century and has been much the same since. Although in recent years the local cheese supplier was told not to offer up the customary wheel of Double Gloucester but authorities, a Dutch equivalent stepped in. To see it in action this year head to Cooper’s Hill for midday on the late spring bank holiday, which this year falls on May 25. The World Bog Snorkelling Championships in Llanwrtyd Wells, Wales, will be held this year on August 30 . BOG SNORKELLING: LLANWRTYD WELLS, WALES . Much like the cheese rolling, those who compete in the World Bog Snorkelling Championships have a bit of a screw loose but also have a ball of a time in the process. The Welsh town of Llanwrtyd Wells is famed for its wacky events, with the bog swimming on August 30 preceded this year by the Welsh Open Stone Skimming Championships on May 24 and The Whole Earth Man vs Horse Marathon on June 13. Hundreds compete in the bog snorkelling with participants last year alone coming from France, Germany, Belgium, Portugal, Sweden, South Africa, Australia, New Zealand, USA, Hong Kong and Mali. The winner is the fastest to navigate a 180ft peat bog wearing a snorkel and flippers, the only means by which they can propel themselves. A competitor in the Mud Olympics in Brunsbuettel plays handball in the mud flats of the River Elbe . A women feels the cold of a hose as competitors attempt to wash away the mud after a day of competition . MUD OLYMPICS: BRUNSBUETTEL, GERMANY . It’s hot, sticky and awesome at the Mud Olympics in Brunsbuettel, near Hamburg in northern Germany, where the annual event is held on the mud flats of the River Elbe. Known in German as Wattoluempiade (Tideland Olympics), the Games feature hundreds of competitors not afraid to get down and dirty as they compete in filthy versions of handball, volleyball, football and tug of war, and more. The event is so popular that the places for most of the sports for this year's games on July 11 were booked out within 50 seconds of entries opening, so it's as exclusive as it is dirty. Each year Wattoluempiade raises money for the region's cancer sufferers and in total since 2004 it has brought in more than €250,000. Camel wrestling has taken place in Turkey for more than 2,000 years and attracts crowds of more than 20,000 . CAMEL WRESTLING: SELCUK, TURKEY . Not for everyone, in particular animal welfare groups who oppose it, or the feint of heart but certainly historic - camel wrestling has been going on in Turkey for more than 2,000 years. More than 20,000 people gather for the 20,000 people will gather again for the annual Selcuk Efes Camel Wrestling Festival in January, which has run in its current form by Turkey's Ministry of Culture and Tourism since 1984. The Tulu camels are bred especially for wrestling and much like their human boxing counterparts are matched based on their age and weight to ensure a fair fight. What compels the competing male camels to fight? A female camel of course, which is why the main in Selcuk in Turkey’s south coincides with mating season. A prisoner is bucked off a bull in front of a packed stadium at the Angola Rodeo at Louisiana State Penitentiary . PRISON RODEO: LOUISIANA, USA . This is precisely what it says on the packet - a rodeo in which prisoners are the stars of the show. And it's a far bigger industry and a better spectacle than you’d expect. Prison rodeos are held throughout the United States but the oldest of its kind is the Angola Rodeo held at Louisiana State Penitentiary, which has been going strong since 1965. Spectators can buy tickets and attend like any other sporting event, only they’re in a jail so restrictions such as not being allowed to carry weapons apply. When the spring rodeo is held on the weekend of April 18 and 19, bull riding will as always be the main event, but some visitors come especially for the arts and crafts market. And yes, the goods are made by the prisoners. A bizarre even among the bucking broncos and barrel races is convict poker, which features four prisoners playing poker while an angry bull runs around the arena, sometimes with painful results. Funds raised by the rodeo go back into the running of the rodeo and into the Inmate Welfare Fund, which provides inmates with educational and recreational supplies. Naadam festivals take place throughout Mongolia, with the biggest here in Ulaanbaatar . NAADAM: ULAANBAATAR, MONGOLIA . The 'manly' sports of Mongolia are celebrated at this ancient festival held all over the country from July 11 to 13 and all-comers, including tourists, are welcome as competitors or spectators. The festival's full name is 'eriin gurvan naadam', meaning 'the three games of men', which are wrestling, horse riding and archery. And despite it being very much a traditional games, it's moving with the times and women can now compete in all but the wrestling. In 2010, Naadam was inscribed on the Representative List of the Intangible Cultural Heritage of Humanity of UNESCO and a host of travel companies offer guided tours. Gregor Edmunds competes in the caber toss (left) and weight over a bar at Cowal Highland Gathering . HIGHLAND GAMES: DUNOON, SCOTLAND . As Scottish as whisky and haggis, Highland Games are held throughout the country from May to September with as many as 60 sports contested. The biggest of them all is the Cowal Highland Gathering over the last weekend in August which has been going in Dunoon since way back in 1894. Among the most popular events is the caber toss which sees massive guys in kilts throwing a giant log in the air and trying to get the top of it to land nearest to them - they say it originates from when such a technique was used to create bridge crossings over waterways. Other events include the throwing of a massive stone, weight throwing contests judges on either distance or height and the sheaf toss in which a pitchfork is used to throw a heavy clump of straw over a bar. Pipe bands and Highland dancing competitions along with local food and general frivolity are also important parts of such festivals. Entry to the three days of the Snow Polo World Cup in St Moritz is free, but it's not exactly cheap . SNOW POLO: ST MORITZ, SWITZERLAND . One of the great strengths of sports is their all-inclusive ability to bring different walks of life together on a level playing field - you wouldn't think snow polo is one of those though. However, since the  Snow Polo World Cup has been held in St Moritz it's be a free event for spectators keen to watch from the stands or the edge of the field. This doesn't include accommodation at the relatively pricey resort, or food, or the inevitable champagne that would seem appropriate at such an affair. VIP tickets are also available for sit-down lunches and other perks. Still, more than 12,000 people watched the 2015 edition of the cup in January and more are expected for the 2016 event from January 29 to 31. The event has been held here since 1985 as teams gather from around the globe to play on the idyllic frozen lake for the Cartier Trophy. With snow-capped mountains of the Engadin Valley as the back drop and all manner of accompanying events, the pricey hotels of the ski resort region are also packed at this time so book well ahead.","Traditional sports in Scotland's Highland Games and Mongolia's Naadam .

8960977b4c0812a3e26747e6b384a0aa33050e17,"Olivier Giroud might have played a key role in Arsenal's Champions League exit against Monaco, but the French forward's form otherwise is as good as any other striker in Europe. Only Lionel Messi can match his statistics in 2015. Giroud has 11 goals in 15 games so far this calendar year, a ratio that puts him ahead of Ballon d'Or winner Cristiano Ronaldo as one of Europe's leading marksmen and his strikes have helped Arsenal to become the Barclays Premier League's form team. Their French centre forward's impressive streak has helped Arsenal move to within a point of second-placed Manchester City and they look all-but certain to qualify for the Champions League in one of the most competitive battles for the top four in recent years. Olivier Giroud has been in fine form for Arsenal so far in 2015, notching 11 goals in just 15 appearances .

Messi, though, has 20 in 19 games averaging 0.95 goals per game. Even the prolific Harry Kane at north London rivals Tottenham Hotspur cannot quite match Giroud. His 13 goals in 18 games in 2015 giving him a rate of 0.72, just slightly lower than the 28-year-old Frenchman. After scoring both goals in Arsenal's 2-1 win over Newcastle United, Giroud's efforts are being appreciated by his manager as well as his critics. Giroud gets ahead of Newcastle defender Mike Williamson to score the first of his two goals at the weekend . The French striker scored a second goal within four minutes, nodding in a corner with ease . Asked if Giroud is world-class, manager Arsene Wenger said: 'I think so and he is scoring the goals to prove it. But I believe there is still room for improvement. 'Technically, he is a much better player than he was. His touch, his link play, his finishing, they have all improved. If you saw footage of him when he first arrived and now, it is obvious he is a better player. 'He is a fighter as well and a player with good mental strength. At 22 or 23 he played in Division Three in France, and now he is at Arsenal.' Arsene Wenger now ranks Giroud as world-class and says he has improved since joining Arsenal .

Authorites said on Monday that Blum, together with an unnamed companion, had been hiking about 6:30 p.m. ‘when a structural collapse of the rock occurred’ at Point Reyes National Seashore. After emergency personnel reached Blum and her companion, she was flown to Bear Valley Ranger Station, where she was pronounced dead. Nancy Blum, 58, of San Francisco died on Saturday after falling 70 foot to her death when the Arch Rock at Point Reyes National Seashore collapsed into the sea .

The National Park Service and the county coroner's office are investigating the cause of Blum's death, reports SFGate. 'The cause of death will be pending the completion of toxicology studies,' the sheriff's office said in a statement. Blum’s hiking companion continues to be treated for life-threatening injuries. The two visitors were standing on the Arch Rock lookout point when the bluff gave way and the pair fell about 70 feet, winding up covered with rocks and debris. The National Park Service had posted signs at the site on Thursday warning hikers that a fissure along the top of Arch Rock may have weakened the cliff and that walking along the edge was potentially dangerous. The park did not close the trail and in spite of the warnings, one hiker who visited the park  told the San Francisco Chronicle that she had seen dozens of people walking in the area.

762fba4e6b32734289238422d9420703c554a2e3,"Celtic captain Scott Brown has insisted he has no reason to fear being banned for Sunday’s League Cup Final and called on critics of his Tannadice tackle on Nadir Ciftci to ‘man up’. The Parkhead skipper, whose heavy challenge on the Dundee United striker sparked a melee during a stormy Scottish Cup quarter-final at the weekend, is one of a number of players who will find out on Tuesday if they face retrospective action from the SFA. But, dismissing any concern, Brown said: ‘Am I worried about being cited? Not in the slightest. The referee was two yards away and he had a clear view of my tackle and he saw that I won the ball. Celtic's Scott Brown has accused Dundee United forward Nadir Ciftci of 'blatantly' kicking him in the head . ‘It was a great tackle. He was fine with it and so was the linesman. They saw what they saw and they made their decisions. ‘At the end of the day, it’s a man’s sport. People need to man up a bit. People moan about the tackles, but if the ball is there to be won, go and win it. As long as it’s not dangerous and you are not flying two-footed into somebody.’ In the wake of an absorbing 1-1 draw game that saw three red cards and two penalties, one of which was saved, the Tannadice club announced they are appealing the red card issued to midfielder Paul Paton. The luckless Paton was the victim of mistaken identity by referee Craig Thomson, at the behest of assistant referee Graham Chambers, after his team-mate Calum Butcher clashed on the ground with Celtic’s Virgil van Dijk. But while Paton’s appeal on Thursday is expected to be straightforward, Van Dijk faces a 48 hours cup final sweat after Celtic also appealed his red card. Brown holds his head during the bad-tempered Scottish Cup quarter-final on Sunday afternoon . And in what is shaping up as a disciplinary D-Day, United trio Cifti, Butcher and Aidan Connolly will join Brown in finding out by 3pm this afternoon whether they face retrospective disciplinary action from SFA compliance officer Tony McGlennan. Ciftci appeared to kick Brown in the face following the Celtic man’s heavy challenge, while Butcher could be hit with a red card for his role in the clash with van Dijk. Connolly, meanwhile, could face a simulation charge after Celtic boss Ronny Deila accused him of diving to win his team’s first half penalty kick, scored by Ciftci. Paul Dixon was the other sending off during Sunday’s match but United won’t contest that and he misses the Scottish Cup replay at Parkhead on March 18. After the cup match, United boss Jackie McNamara said much of the trouble could have been avoided if referee Craig Thomson had sent off Brown for his initial challenge on Ciftci. The referee did not even give a foul but the Celtic captain – who called for video evidence to be introduced to help the under-fire match officials – added: ‘I was kicked in the head (by Ciftci). You can blatantly see that. We will see what happens with that. At the time I didn’t know who it was. I felt a boot against my face. ‘There was so much going on at the time, I didn’t know who it was until I watched it again afterwards. ‘I’m probably lucky it was to my face, and not another part of my body. Leigh Griffiths wheels away to celebrate his equaliser in the 1-1 draw with Dundee United . Celtic defender Virgil van Dijk (right) was sent off after only nine minutes of the Scottish Cup quarter-final . In a case of mistaken identity, the referee also sent off Dundee United's Paul Paton . ‘Do I hope Virgil wins his appeal? That would be great but we will see. But I didn’t see that incident because I had (Ciftci’s) studs in my face at the time. You could see the marks, you still can.’ Brown, who was speaking at Lesser Hampden where he was publicising Sunday’s showpiece occasion, also backed up his boss Deila’s assertion that Connolly had been guilty of simulation to win a penalty. ‘It was a blatant dive,’ said Brown. ‘I was close by. Anthony (Stokes) put his leg in but you can see that he has pulled his leg away before the lad has gone down. ‘He played it really well. I will give him that but we had (Derk Boerrigter) get a two-match ban for that so I think it was dealt with rightly. You don’t want to see people cheating whether it helps you or not. It is not a nice part of the game.’ Brown refused to be critical of match officials Thomson and Chambers, and instead insisted video evidence would have cleared up the confusion. ‘I think yesterday would have been ideal for it,’ he said. ‘We stopped the game for four or five minutes and it was the wrong decision that Paton got sent off. ‘If we had watched that back we would have clearly seen who it was. ‘It wouldn’t stop the game every two minutes, (only with) big decisions like that. We definitely need that.’","Dundee United and Celtic drew 1-1 at Tannadice on Sunday .

c42148a52e8cd58d5f67b89789c835c0f3e030e0,"Five former patients of Desmond D'Mello have tested positive for hepatitis C after claims he ignored infection control rules . Five former patients of a dentist accused of putting lives at risk amid claims he flouted infection control rules, have tested positive for hepatitis C. Desmond D'Mello's alleged refusal to follow NHS safety guidelines sparked the biggest patient recall after he was secretly filmed treating 166 patients across three days. NHS England alerted 22,000 patients after fears they could have been exposed to blood-borne diseases including HIV and hepatitis while being treated at the Daybrook Dental Practice in Nottingham. A total of 4,526 patients were tested and five were diagnosed with hepatitis C as a result, health bosses confirmed. No cases of hepatitis B or HIV were found. The recall was issued in November,  and an investigation into apparent breaches of infection control procedures by Mr D'Mello was launched. The dentist, who ran his practice for 32 years, was suspended. Dr Doug Black, Medical Director for NHS England in Nottinghamshire, said: 'We have always been clear that the risk to patients was low, but we still had a duty to inform patients of this and offer the option for them to be tested. 'Treatments are available for all of the blood-borne viruses tested for, so we are pleased that these individuals have been identified and offered clinical support to aid their well-being. 'Now that this patient screening exercise is complete, we will be focusing our efforts on what we can learn from this incident and ensuring all our findings are shared with the General Dental Council to inform their ongoing investigation into Mr D'Mello.' Mr D'Mello is being investigated by the Care Quality Commission and the General Dental Council after he was secretly filmed by a whistleblower failing to change his medical gloves between patients or properly sterilise equipment. The dentist went to ground after his work was called into question and has never spoken publicly about the allegations. Dr Vanessa MacGregor, consultant in communicable disease control at Public Health England, East Midlands said: 'With such a high number of people being tested for hepatitis B, hepatitis C and HIV, the small number of positives that have been picked up as a result of screening is in line with what we would expect to see due to the very low prevalence of these blood-borne viruses within the community. 'Effective treatments are available for all blood-borne viruses, which is why it is important to identify anyone who may have been at risk of infection, so treatment can be started if necessary.' Mr D'Mello, who ran the Daybrook Dental Practice in Nottingham, which has now changed name and is under new ownership, sparked the biggest patient recall after he was secretly filmed treating 166 patients across three days amid allegations he failed to follow NHS safety procedures . Patients who tested positive were informed by their GPs and referred for further clinical advice and testing. Since August 2014 the former Daybrook Dental Practice has been under new ownership by Southern Dental, which is not in connected to this incident. A spokesman for NHS England said any former patients of Mr D'Mello who have not yet accessed testing and wish to do so should contact their GP. Many of his former patients are taking legal action against the dentist. Around 200 are building cases with legal firm the Dental Law Partnership. David Corless-Smith, a solicitor with the company, said last week: 'Desmond D'Mello was a master of five-minute dentistry and you can't do much that is going to last a long time in five minutes. 'We have 200 of Mr D'Mello's former patients bringing claims for nervous shock of being told they may have contracted a life-threatening infection but half of those are pursuing claims for poor treatment.'","Desmond D'Mello was suspended amid claims he flouted safety rules .

18b2a91c9f4d7344b94edf542f5f6bf428cc1ca5,"Photographs of Yosemite's iconic Half Dome peak have revealed the astonishing extent of California's historic drought. The images, which show the peak in the third week of March each year between 2011 and 2015, reveal how swiftly snowfall has depleted year to year. The snow is typically at its deepest in the area in late March and, as seen in the 2011 photograph, it previously covered peaks including the Half Dome. But this year, the fourth consecutive year of drought in California, the 9,000-foot peak doesn't bear a single flake of snow. Earlier this month, officials reported that the Sierra Nevada snowpack, which gives an indication of upcoming water supply, is just five per cent of its normal depth - and barely above the record low set in 1991. The lack of water comes after the winter of 2014 was the hottest on record for California. Scroll down for video . Hidden: A photo taken by a Yosemite Conservancy webcam on March 19, 2011 shows Yosemite's Half Dome peak covered with snow . Depleting: The following year, in March 2012, the iconic peak is similarly covered in deep snow . In response, state regulators voted earlier this month to impose a new set of water conservation rules, such as bans on watering yards and stopping restaurants serving customers water unless they specifically ask for it. Farmers have said they expected to leave as much as a million acres unplanted, nearly twice the amount of last year, the New York Times reported. 'It looks like we are on our way to the worst snowpack in history,' state climatologists Michael Anderson told the Times. 'Unless we end up with some particularly good snows here in March, we are going to end up with a new lowest rank here.' But the Half Dome peak is likely to stay clear of snow because there are no major snowstorms forecast for the rest of the month. Earlier this month, the United States Department of Agriculture noted that as well as California, droughts are ravaging Nevada and Utah and also parts of Arizona, New Mexico, Colorado, Washington and Oregon. The photographs were taken by the Yosemite webcam provided by Yosemite Conservancy, which is funded by donations. While all years show the peak on March 19, the 2014 image shows it on March 17 as a March 19 photograph was not available.

It was the Pleasant Pointe Assisted Living residents, who are all in their 80s and 90s, who came up with the idea for a charity calendar that showed a little bit of skin. Teresa Morris, the administrator of the Barberton rest home, said the residents were inspired by a similar calendar another retirement center nearby had done. Wilma Purvis and Norma Elfrink were the centerfold for the stripped down charity calendar made by residents of the Pleasant Pointe Assisted Living facility in Barberton, Ohio . 'They were so cute about it,' she told the Daily Mail Online. 'It wasn't about shock value, but to be bold and beautiful.' Morris said the only thing her mother, who was Miss July, was worried about was getting her hair done before the shoot. The calendar features the proud models in a variety of places and poses, often with an appropriate holiday theme. Miss February, 87-year-old Dottie Rutter, lies in a bubble bath covered in rose petals as she enjoys a box of chocolates to honor Valentine's Day. The 98-year-old Maxine Garden, who  passed away after the shoot, can be seen smiling behind a large exercise ball, happy bare (almost) all in the facility's gym. The calendar's centerfold is Wilma Purvis, 94, and Norma Elfrink, 91, playing a game of poker with some very large cards - not to mention Coronas and cigars. Miss October Jean Genet (right), 90, told Daily Mail Online that she jumped at the chance to be in the calendar when asked.'It's a wonderful thing, to feel young again,' she said . Lifetime Barbertown resident and Miss October Jean Genet, 90, was a housewife before moving into Pleasant Pointe. She told Daily Mail Online that she jumped at the chance to be in the calendar when asked. 'It's a wonderful thing, to feel young again,' she said. She said none of the models said no to the shoot in December and that she 'felt glamorous' after taking off her clothes to pose in a witches hat. Mrs Genet was sad that her husband, who died in November, did not get to see the calendar. However, she said her whole family, which includes five daughters, 14 grandchilden and 30 great-grandchildren, have picked up copies. 'They can't believe that's grandma,' she said. Teresa Morris, the administrator of the Barberton rest home, told the Daily Mail Online the calendar 'wasn't about shock value, but to be bold and beautiful' The calendar features the proud models in a variety of places and poses, often with an appropriate holiday theme . Pleasant Pointe spokesperson Michelle Clapper said the residents were 'very excited' to be a part of the charity calendar, she told the Akron Beacon Journal. She said they were 'like 20-year-olds' on the morning of the big shoot, giggling and 'having the time of their lives'. 'I do not believe the elderly should just sit around staring at each other,' she said. 'I want a fun environment. I love supporting their independence.' 'I wanted them to decide what they wanted to do,' said Morris. 'That's what we're here for.' Proceeds from the calendars, which are selling for $12, will held provide shoes for children who attend schools in the area. The residents recently donated $2,000 to the fund. Pleasant Pointe says that it has had to order more calendars to keep up with demand, according to WKYC. None of the residents had ever done any sort of naked modeling before.

Andrew Skarbek, 47, has been competing on the Channel 7 afternoon quiz Million Dollar Minute for 23 episodes. He defeated 46 contestants and answered more than 589 questions on his journey to becoming Australia's newest millionaire. ‘You can call it million dollar minute but its been more like a million dollar month.’ Mr Skarbek quipped to Daily Mail Australia. Scroll down for video . Host Simon Reeve, left, hands Andrew Skarbek, right, $1,016,000 making him the biggest cash prize winner in Australian television history . Andrew Skarbek said he tried to outsmart the producers, looking for his wife, knowing that she would only be there if he took out the big prize . Robert Menzies first became prime minister as leader of which party? a) UAP . b) DLP . c) NCP . Which of these singers is the eldest? a) Billy Joel . b) David Bowie . c) Bruce Springsteen . The Burke and Wills expedition left Melbourne in which year? a) 1854 . b) 1856 . c) 1860 . Which of these teams was first to race in a Formula 1 Grand Prix . a) Tyrrell . b) Sauber . c) Jordan .

In the final nail-biting minute of the show he was asked the following historical question: 'The Burke and Wills expedition left Melbourne in which year?' The trivia buff correctly answered '1860' but said it left like a 'lifetime' before the big green tick rolled around, signalling a triumphant end to an extremely nerve-racking month. As his wife of 19 years, Jenny, joined him on stage for his winning moment on Friday afternoon, Mr Skarbek, from Hawthorn, Victoria, said although it would 'take a while to sink in', all he felt was overwhelming relief. ‘It’s incredible! I think at this stage it’s more relief than anything seeing as it's been such a long process,‘ Mr Skarbek said. He admitted it's been a 'hard slog' but he relished the challenge and knew he wanted to take it all the way. 'It's about more than the money now. It's about proving to myself that I can do it,' he said. Being the curious man he is Mr Skarbek said if he walked away with the smaller jackpots of $500,000 or $750,000, he would never have stopped wondering if he could have made it to the million. ‘I know I could have lived with taking the risk. If you’re prepared and back yourself, you can live with loosing.' He was adamant that not knowing that would have eaten him alive. Mr Skarbek was quick to recognise he wasn't alone on his million dollar journey, crediting his wife for supporting and coaching him through the month long adventure. 'She would stay up asking me questions until 2 in the morning, until it felt like our eyes bled,’ he said. Becoming the longest standing contestant on the show Mr Skarbek spent 23 episodes on Million Dollar Minute in what he calls his 'million dollar month’ Being the curious man he is Mr Skarbek said if he walked away with the smaller jackpots of $500,000 or $750,000, he would never have stopped wondering if he could have made it to the million. ‘I know I could have lived with taking the risk.

Mr Skarbek was quick to recognise he wasn't alone on his million dollar journey, crediting his wife for supporting and coaching him through the month long adventure. 'She would stay up asking me questions until 2 in the morning, until it felt like our eyes bled,’ he said. The humble winner said it was hard for him to believe he'd achieved 'permanent financial security and become the biggest winner in Australian quiz show history. 'It will change our lives but we are pretty down to earth and I know it wont change us.’ Mr Skarbek hit financial trouble after being diagnosed with mucosa associated lymphoid tissue (MALT) lymphoma which required an expensive twice-weekly blood transfusion. Mr Skarbek, who spent years dragging his wife Jenny to pub trivia nights, got into debt when he had to pay sky-high medical bills to treat his cancer . His six-month treatment cost $50,000, putting further strain on the couple who said they were trapped in the renting cycle. 'My wife and I have been living hand to mouth and even had to call on our parents to help cover the blow-out on medical bills with my six-month cancer treatment. Million Dollar Minute has saved us,' he said. Things started to turn around when Mr Skarbek was given a clean bill of health and was told he had got on to the the show in the same week. 'Sometimes you get in a rut. You know things will improve eventually but it's hard to see how. Then I got the great medical news and found out I was going to make the show,' he said. 'A whole series of things just started coming my way.' With a 'life-changing' amount of money now sitting in his bank account Mr Skarbek said, after years of renting, he can't wait to become a home owner. 'When we were younger and had the chance to buy a house we could never find the perfect property. Then the market went berserk and although we were saving like crazy, we were shut out.’ ‘This will be the house that trivia built,’ he joked. After buying a home Mr Skarbek says he'll use some of the prize money to take his wife around the world . Having a good understanding what it's like to struggle financially Mr Skarbek said his wife was adamant they share their good fortune by making a generous donation to the Smith Family. 'Jenny was thinking about how tough some people do it and what a magical thing it would be to win that money and help someone else that's in need,' he said. Not only will they satisfy their own wanderlust with a trip around the word, Mr Skarbek said his mother hasn’t been back to her native Poland in 15 years and said he cant wait to send the 78-year-old home in style, on a business class flight. Mr Skarbek says his 78-year-old mother Sophie has always supported him and now it's his turn to repay the favour by sending her back to her native Poland for a holiday after 15 years . Mr Skarbek, pictured as a child with family members, said travelling the world was the 'greatest gift' he was given . A young Mr Skarbek was nicknamed 'The Professor' Surprisingly, Mr Skarbek said he wasn't a particularly good student at school, instead saying he inherited his thirst for knowledge from his father. 'Ever since I was a little kid a lot of my family used to nickname me 'The Professor'. I was always reading,' he said. He spent his younger years travelling the world with his family which he said was the 'greatest gift' he was ever given. Mr Skarbek said he has been an avid trivia player at his local pub for as long as he can remember and was elated to find his years of training could be put to good use. 'This is the only chance I've had to actually do something with my trivia skills,' he said. After spending 15 years in the energy industry Mr Skarbek said he can't wait to leave his job and spend some time relaxing with his family. ‘I have moments where I know it’s happened and I have moments where sometimes it feels like a dream.’ Mr Skarbek is the first Million Dollar Minute contestant to win the million dollar jackpot with his jackpot including $16,000 in ‘safe money’ he accumulated during the games.

0875a3a89684ad75bbb6dd9d5514ddd678828dca,"Should Rangers win promotion to the Premiership this season they will have to pay Newcastle United £500,000 as part of the loan deal struck with the St James' Park club for five players. The details emerged this morning as Rangers released financial results which showed the club had made losses after tax of £2.89m for the six-month period to 31 December 2014. Interim chairman Paul Murray described the accounts as 'disappointing'. Haris Vuckic celebrates after scoring in Rangers' 4-1 victory against Cowdenbeath on Saturday . This arrangement with Newcastle was part of a deal struck by the previous board for five fringe players - Gael Bigirimana, Haris Vuckic, Kevin Mbabu, Remie Streete and Shane Ferguson. Only Vuckic has made any sort of impact for the Ibrox club so far. Indeed three of the five players who signed the loan agreements have yet to kick a ball for Rangers, who are currently second in the Championship and can only now be promoted through the play-offs. The prize money for finishing as runners-up in the second tier is £342,000. Despite promotion to the Championship, revenue fell £100,000 to £13.1m, though the club earned £1.3m from hosting the Commonwealth Games rugby sevens. Sponsorship revenue also dropped, falling by £0.3m to £0.4m. Loan signings Vuckic (centre), Gael Bigirimana (left) and Remie Streete are unveiled at Murray Park last month . Murray, who along with Dave King and John Gilligan, ousted the previous board, said: 'The new directors have been in place only a matter of weeks but have already started to repair the damage caused through recent years of neglect and disrespect for this club, its people and its history. 'The mismanagement of the club in recent years has been simply staggering. 'As the Interim Accounts prove, the new board has inherited major problems but while campaigning for change we all knew the club would be in need of major restructuring and repair on all fronts. Paul Murray (left) and Dave King are pictured back at Ibrox after the EGM earlier this month . 'We can and we will return this club to a strong and profitable footing through strategic planning, investment and re-engagement with all of our stakeholders. 'Too many of them have been lost or disenfranchised because of successive failings by a series of directors over the last four years in particular. But they are gone now and this is a new era for this great and special club which must be regenerated, not only for its own good but for the greater good of Scottish football.'","Rangers will owe Newcastle United £500,000 if they win promotion .

Joint research by Ipsos and PayPal, conducted in the past 12 months on 1001 respondents, found that more than half of those who had considered returning an unwanted item had failed to do so mainly due to shipping costs. Other factors also included unnecessary hassle  or complicated returns processes.

64668be8e1bb358321f4ef62bd11db815df27cf0,"(CNN)The family of an unarmed biracial 19-year-old killed by police in Madison, Wisconsin, is pushing for peaceful protests online and in the streets. ""Our hands are stained with the blood of my nephew, and we are all left to deal with the aftermath,"" Turin Carter, the teen's uncle, told reporters on Monday. Carter stressed that his family wasn't anti-police, but said Tony Robinson's death ""highlights a universal problem with law enforcement and how its procedures have been carried out ... specifically as it pertains to the systematic targeting of young black males."" But he said the problem goes beyond the chants of ""black lives matter"" that have already been used at protests over the case. ""I encourage everybody to show support regardless of race because this is truly a universal issue. ... We don't want to stop at just 'black lives matter,' because all lives matter,"" he said. The deadly confrontation has made Madison the latest epicenter of protests. Here's what we know about the Friday night shooting. The incident started when authorities got a call that a black male was yelling and jumping in front of cars, Madison Police Chief Mike Koval said. Dispatchers identified him as Tony Robinson, according to 911 audio obtained by WKOW. A little later, the dispatcher says, ""Apparently Tony hit one of his friends. No weapons seen."" About four minutes later, the dispatcher says, ""I got another call for the same suspect at [the same address]. He tried to strangle another patron."" About 30 seconds later, an unidentified officer says, ""Shots fired, shots fired."" When Officer Matt Kenny went to the apartment, he heard some commotion and forced his way in, Koval said. ""Once inside the home the subject involved in this incident -- the same one allegedly out in traffic and that had battered someone -- assaulted my officer,"" Koval said. After that, according to the chief, ""The officer did draw his revolver and subsequently shot the subject."" Koval said it's understandable why protesters are outraged. ""He was unarmed. That's going to make this all the more complicated for the investigators, the public, to accept, to understand ... why deadly force had to be used,"" he said. A neighbor in the duplex said she heard it all happen. Two brothers shared the other apartment in the duplex, and Robinson was their friend, Kathy Bufton said. ""I heard rustling and things being knocked over and my kitchen ceiling actually kind of shook. ... I figured something was going on,"" she said. ""I heard somebody go down the stairs. And then I heard the shots."" There were 4-6 shots fired, Bufton said. For the family, that's a horrifying reality. ""It takes one bullet from a trained gunman to end a life. It takes one bullet,"" Carter said Monday. ""And we know how many were fired."" This isn't the first time Kenny used lethal force. In 2007, he shot and killed a man in what the police chief described as a ""suicide by cop."" Kenny was exonerated of wrongdoing and received a commendation. During the confrontation Friday night, Kenny suffered a blow to the head, Koval said. He has been placed on paid administrative leave pending an investigation. ""It's a stressful period for him and his family, but he also understands that a family here has suffered a tragic loss and he understands that there has to be an investigation,"" said James Palmer, executive director of the Wisconsin Professional Police Association. Under Wisconsin law, officer-involved shootings are investigated by an outside agency, in this case the Division of Criminal Investigation. Once the division completes its investigation, the report will go to the local district attorney, Koval said. Palmer declined to comment on the ongoing investigation, but said there are some circumstances when an unarmed person could still be seen as posing a deadly threat to a police officer. ""The real fear for any officer when he's being attacked, generally speaking, is that their weapon will be taken away,"" Palmer said, ""and an unarmed individual can become armed very quickly."" Wisconsin Circuit Court documents indicate Robinson pleaded guilty in December to an armed robbery that occurred last April. His mother, Andrea Irwin, painted a different picture of the teen: ""My son has never been a violent person, never,"" she told CNN affiliate WKOW. ""To die in such a violent way baffles me."" The police chief refused to comment on Robinson's criminal history or run-ins with police. ""I could but I choose not to,"" he said at a press conference Saturday. ""I frankly think it is, for our purposes today, wholly inappropriate and I am not going to blemish anyone's character, particularly someone's as young as his."" On Monday, Robinson's uncle told reporters his nephew wasn't a saint and had made some poor decisions, but was still a ""good, kindhearted kid."" ""We paint him as a human being, a 19-year-old who made a terrible mistake at one point, which is completely dissociated from this act,"" he said. Madison Mayor Paul Soglin, who said he met with Robinson's family the night of the shooting, said officials aren't going to put the teen on trial. ""That's not what this is about. What this is about is finding out exactly what happened that night and to determine, then, responsibility,"" he told CNN's ""AC360."" ""We know that he was not armed, and as far as the police chief and I are concerned ... the fact that Tony was involved in any kind of transgression in the past has nothing to do with this present tragedy."" Because Robinson did not have a weapon, the death spurred memories of other unarmed black men killed by police: Michael Brown in Ferguson, Missouri. Eric Garner in Staten Island, New York. Over the weekend, protesters filled streets in Madison. On Monday, demonstrators packed the Wisconsin State Capitol. They chanted and carried a banner with a familiar message: ""Black lives matter."" Asked the difference between Ferguson and Madison, Carter said Monday the cases are ""similar, but different,"" noting that his nephew's ""racial ambiguity"" was an important part of his identity. ""Tony's racial ambiguity reinforces the fact that America's racial lines are completely, 100% blurred,"" he said. ""My sister is a white mother of black children who had black and white relatives. We are all multiple races and we each have our own complex heritage."" Among the protesters are members of the Young, Gifted and Black Coalition that was formed last summer after the Michael Brown shooting in Ferguson. The group wants more reactive policing in African-American neighborhoods, said group member Brandi Grayson. She said Madison police park on street corners in African-American neighborhoods and wait for something to happen, which leads to residents being hassled. That doesn't happen in white neighborhoods, she said. ""In light of so many things that have happened not just across the country, but in our own community, it's understandable that the reaction at the scene and of some of our citizens is extremely volatile, emotional and upsetting,"" Chief Koval told CNN affiliate WKOW-TV. ""And we understand that. That's absolutely appropriate under these circumstances. We would urge, obviously, that everyone exercise restraint."" Koval said he knows it may be difficult for Madison to move forward after Robinson's death. He visited the teen's grandmother over the weekend but was advised by them to not visit the mother yet because the emotions are still too raw. ""We need to start, as any healing or any reconciliation should, with an 'Im sorry,' and I've done that privately, and I'm attempting to do that publicly and that's the only way we can sort of begin the healing or the rift that may take years, if at all, to mend,"" the police chief said. ""But the effort has to be there. So we have to acknowledge it, we have to own it, we have to say we are sorry at the outset for it and then we have to show affirmative steps in moving forward to bring the community back into the fold, as it were."" CNN's Rosa Flores, Gary Tuchman, Brianna Keilar, Ralph Ellis, Joe Sutton and Greg Botelho contributed to this report.","Uncle: The shooting highlights ""systematic targeting of young black males""

Then, after bleaching her hair for the third time in three weeks, the Keeping Up with the Kardashians star was spotted sporting damaged locks while out with husband Kanye and daughter North. Her blonde hair was pulled back into a hasty ponytail and strands had fallen out and blew listlessly in the ocean breeze on the Malibu family outing on Sunday. Celebrity hairdresser Andrew Jose, ambassador for Salon Science, had warned that if she's not careful, Kim could suffer some serious breakage due to her blonde preference. Later that day: Kim was spotted clocking in some gym time . Zip up: The star wore a figure hugging jacket . Andrew, who has styled the tresses of Alanis Morissette, Jamie Campbell Bower and Louise Redknapp, said: 'This type of bleach blonde look goes beyond fashion and if done well can look high-end and powerful. 'Be warned though, this look is definitely not for the faint-hearted. Not only does maintaining the regrowth take a lot of commitment but the chemical process of bleach on the hair can be incredibly damaging.' He added: 'Overuse and repeated application of bleach to the scalp can strip the hair of moisture and damage the follicle. 'This may cause the hair to either fall out from the root or to break at the weakest point along the hair shaft.' Cool customer: Kim was dressed in all black as she slicked her dark locks into a tight pony tail .","She debuted her platinum-blonde locks on March 5, in time for Paris Fashion Week .

8e649128b35c9696a8547197d09db3bfd8f3afdb,"According to some accounts, the wealth of the ancient Roman empire was reflected in the very fabric of the city - with buildings of sparkling white marble at its centre. Even the founder of the Roman empire, Emperor Augustus claimed that he had 'found Rome a city of bricks and left it a city of marble'. But new research by historians at the University of California Los Angeles has now cast doubt on this boast. Scroll down to explore ancient Rome in 3D . This reconstruction by historians at the University of California shows how Rome would have looked under the rule of Augustus and reveals that many of the buildings were made from brick (shown in grey) while only a few temples were constructed from marble (pink) Using architectural computer modelling software they have been able to reconstruct the entire city to reveal how it would have looked during the rule of Augustus between 44BC and 14AD. The Pantheon, Trajan's Market and the Colosseum have remained standing for nearly 2,000 years. Scientists claim to have found a 'secret' ingredient in Roman concrete that helped it endure the elements. Using X ray beams at the Advanced Light Source (ALS), researchers were able to study a reproduction of Roman volcanic ash-lime mortar. In the concrete walls of Trajan's Markets, constructed around 110 CE, this mortar binds cobble-sized fragments of tuff and brick. Scientists looked at the mineralogical changes that took place in the curing of the mortar over a period of 180 days and compared the results to 1,900 year old samples of the original. The team discovered that the volcanic ash creates a crystal structure that prevents tiny cracks from spreading. They also found that the use of strätlingite crystals in the material showed no corrosion, with their smooth surface suggesting stability. They found that in fact only a small proportion of the buildings in Rome at the time were converted from brick into marble. Indeed, the few buildings that were built from marble were hidden from view within the city landscape, meaning many historical discriptions of the city's beauty were perhaps exaggerated. Their discovery suggests that the claim attributed to Augustus may have been more of a metaphor than a literal boast. Dr Diana Favro, who led the work, said: 'Many scholars have looked at Augustus’ claim from a political standpoint, as a metaphor for him transforming a republic into an empire. 'I wanted to see if Rome literally transformed under his rule. Given the literary descriptions and artwork, I thought these glittering marble temples on high would be very visible, but they were not.' Dr Favro used information from archaeological and historical records to produce the computer model that can show how the city evolved during Emperor Augustus' rule. Buildings constructed from marble were shaded with pink while those that were made from brick were shaded brown. Those under construction were yellow. When the researchers examined the model, they found just a few buildings were clad with marble, including the Temple of Venus and the Basilica Julia. Dr Favro found that when viewed from the street level, however, these buildings were not widely visible. Shortly before Augustus came to power, the Carrara marble quarries on the northwest coast of Italy were opened, and this was thought to have made marble a popular building material. Augustus commissioned several large marble structures, some of which took 40 years to complete. As a result, massive marble blocks were constantly being moved through the city, causing congestion in the streets. Marble-paved public spaces, which used to only be found in sacred temples and houses of the elite, were also added throughout the city. The 3D model (above) allows researchers to explore the city down to the street level and see how it changed between 44BC and 14AD . The Basilica Julia in the Roman Forum was one of the few buildings to be constructed from marble in Rome under Emperor Augustus . Dr Favro said this may be why Rome earned its reputation as a city of marble. She said: 'Because they saw construction taking place constantly, I believe people really did think that Rome had been transformed into marble. 'But in reality, the city did not greatly transform.' Many artworks, like the painting above, and historical accounts depict Rome under Augustus as being dominated by marble buildings .","Emperor Augustus boasted about how his rule left Rome 'a city of marble' while historical accounts said it glittered .

Dan Diaz was lying in the bed beside his 29-year-old wife when she drank medication to end her life last month. Having been diagnosed with terminal brain cancer just six months before, Maynard became the face of America's Right To Die campaign after moving from California to Oregon and setting a date for her own death. Now, her widower is continuing that battle calling for all states to approve legislation that supports life-ending options for people with terminal illnesses. SCROLL DOWN FOR VIDEO . 'It was peaceful and loving': Dan Diaz has spoken to Oprah about his final moments with Brittany Maynard . Passed away: Diaz's wife controversially chose to end her life with lethal medication last month . Campaign: Maynard documented her final six months and fought for relaxed laws on the right to die . Launching his campaign, Diaz met with Oprah and explained how Maynard chose seven of her closest friends and relatives - and their dogs Bella and Charlie - to stand around the bed in her final moments. 'The mood in the house was very peaceful, very loving,' he said in an interview that will be screened on Sunday. Glassy-eyed, he said each person recited a memory to her before she said her own goodbyes. 'She actually wrote on Facebook a message to her friends and said ""I love you"" to everyone, to me. 'The medication, we brought it in. She was ready.' Love: The couple married in California but later moved to Oregon where Maynard could end her life . Memories: Diaz said Maynard got seven friends and relatives to each tell her a memory . Diaz is continuing the campaign that Maynard started as he lobbies for new legislation . Maynard's two dogs were in the bed with them when she drank the lethal medicine, Diaz said . Then, she drank the lethal cocktail prescribed by her doctor. 'Within five minutes, she fell asleep. It was very peaceful.' It comes after Debbie Ziegler, Brittany Maynard's mom, wrote an article for DailyMail.com describing the moment she watched her only daughter die. 'Brittany, my beautiful, brave girl, had passed away purposefully and peacefully just as she planned. Death had been kind, graceful even, and spared Brittany a great deal of physical pain and mental anguish. 'It was a good death.' A mother's tears: Debbie Ziegler, Maynard's mother, is also campaigning to change laws . Joining Diaz in the campaign for euthanasia, she added: 'But what does a good death look like in America: the land of death phobia? Americans do not like to talk about death. Some say a good death is a natural death, but they often mean dying “in their sleep.” 'Modern medicine has made death seem like a medical failure instead of the natural end of life. The death of a 29-year-old is unthinkable. All of life looms ahead, full of promise. 'We found ourselves as a family: choosing between no more treatment and death – or a treatment plan that felt like torture and then death anyway only a few months later.' Oregon voters approved the Death with Dignity Act in 1994, but opponents persuaded a federal judge to issue an injunction temporarily blocking the law. Voters in November 1997 overwhelmingly reaffirmed the nation's first aid-in-dying law and it's been in place ever since. According to state statistics compiled through Dec. 31, 2013: . — People who have used the law since late 1997: 752 (396 men, 356 women) — People younger than 35 who have used the law: 6 . — Median age of the deceased: 71 . — Percentage of the deceased who were white: 97 . — Percentage who had at least some college: 72 . — Percentage of patients who informed relatives of their decision: 94 . — Percentage of patients who died at a home: 95 percent . — Median minutes between ingestion of lethal drug and unconsciousness: 5 . — Median minutes between ingestion and death: 25 . — Number of terminally ill people who have moved to Oregon to die: unknown .","Dan Diaz, widower of Brittany Maynard, is campaigning for Right To Die .

However, the 11-year-old's teacher parents, Bruce and Linda Bays, have said that three field tests proved their son did not have a leaf from the plant. A Virginia middle school student received a 364-day suspension last September, after school officials said they found him with a marijuana leaf. Speaking to the Roanoke Times, the Bays said there are varying accounts of the September 22 incident involving their son, identified as R.M.B. The couple said they'd heard the boy, who at the time was enrolled in Bedford Middle School's gifted and talented program, had displayed the leaf in a school bathroom, in his homeroom in another account, and while riding the school bus in yet another version. An assistant principal later searched the boy's backpack and pulled out both a lighter and a leaf, before he asked a school resource officer -  who is a deputy for the sheriff's office - to step in, according to the newspaper. Linda Bays told the Roanoke Times 'I asked, ""Can I see the leaf?"" and the deputy said, ""No, it’s already in evidence."" We have never seen the leaf. He’s been out of school for six months.' R.M.B. received an immediate ten-day suspension, before the nearly year-long suspension was issued during a September administrative hearing, the newspaper reported. The Bays told the Roanoke Times that at a November juvenile court hearing, they found out about the leaf's multiple negative test results - and that a prosecutor planned to drop their son's marijuana possession charge. Linda Bays told the newspaper 'I immediately sent a letter to [the school's operations chief Dr. Frederick Duis] requesting a new hearing,' and claimed he told her 'The court system and the school system were two different entities.' The Roanoke Times reported that the couple has sued both the school district and the sheriff's office, claiming school officials violated their son's constitutional due process rights and that the sheriff's office committed malicious prosecution. The Bays told the Roanoke Times their son is being treated by a psychiatrist for depression and panic attacks, and is now anxious regarding being in public. Attorney Jim Guynn, who's representing both defendants, told the newspaper that the resource officer thought the leaf was from a marijuana plant. 'It’s the same punishment and exactly the same result,' Guynn told the Roanoke Times regarding how the school deals with fake drugs and real ones identically. The Bays told the newspaper that their son's denied any wrongdoing multiple times. Linda Bays told the Roanoke Times 'Why would you want an 11-year-old gifted-and-talented student out of school for 364 days?'

The tour group and their guide were making their way down the river between Zimbabwe and Zambia when they saw crocodiles feeding. But as they approached, it became clear that the reptiles were tearing apart the bottom half of a human. Horrified British tourists saw crocodiles eating a man on the banks of the Zambezi River between Zambia and Zimbabwe (file picture) The Daily Telegraph reports that the tourists alerted authorities - but by the time officials had arrived to investigate, the remains of the body had vanished. It quotes a local source as saying: 'All there was to see of him was his trousers. We have had no information about anyone missing from villages around us, so we don't think the man was a local.' Trevor Lane of Zimbabwean conservation group, the Bhejane Trust, said the body was believed to have been a Zambian man. He is thought to have been among a group of 13 suspected poachers ambushed by park rangers in Zimbabwe just days earlier. Mr Lane suggested that one of the poachers was killed in a clash between the two groups and that only nine men made it back over the river to Zambia. When the tourists approached the crocodiles they could see that the reptiles were eating the bottom half of a human (file picture) He reportedly told the South African Press Association: 'We strongly suspect it was a poacher.

b137b9fea5c50478c2a1300b38759c87b87c18c0,"(CNN)The fiancée of former New England Patriots star Aaron Hernandez said at a hearing Friday that she was asked to conceal a box and take it out of her Massachusetts home after the murder of Odin Lloyd in 2013. Shayanna Jenkins' testimony came outside the presence of the jury during a hearing on the limits of her testimony. But it signaled where the prosecution intends to take its questioning of the key witness, who took the stand before the jury later Friday. She is testifying after being granted immunity. Hernandez, the ex-tight end who had a $40 million contract until he was charged with murder, has pleaded not guilty to orchestrating the death of Lloyd, a semi-pro football player. He has also pleaded not guilty to other weapons charges. His co-defendants, Ernest Wallace and Carlos Ortiz, have also pleaded not guilty and will be tried separately. ""You took that box out and concealed it. Were you attempting to do it in a way so that people didn't know what you were doing?"" Bristol County District Attorney William McCauley asked. ""That's correct,"" Jenkins said. The weapon in the case has not been recovered. The prosecution has said Hernandez's high school sweetheart removed the weapon from their North Attleboro home after Lloyd was killed on June 17, 2013. The state also alleges that she lied to a grand jury several times about the presence of guns in the home. She faces possible jail time if found guilty of perjury charges. Jenkins has pleaded not guilty. Jenkins testified she was ""instructed"" to take the box out of the home, and that it was ""important"" for her to get rid of it. On the day after Lloyd's killing, prosecutors have said Jenkins received a coded text message from Hernandez. Search warrants said Hernandez asked his fiancée to remove something from their basement. The text message said: ""Go ... in back of the screen in movie room when u (sic) get home an (sic) there is a box ... jus (sic) in case u were looking for it!!! Member (sic) how you ruined the big tv ... WAS JUST THINKIN bout that lol wink wink love u TTYL....K"" Asked about the text message Friday afternoon, in the presence of the jury, Jenkins said she didn't know what it meant. Jenkins also told the jury that she met her fiance's two alleged accomplices in the killing of Lloyd and gave them $500 in cash as police were questioning Hernandez about the slaying. Jenkins testified that she took Hernandez to a police station on June 18, 2013, and that he asked her to give Wallace money. Wallace was comforting to her, Jenkins told the jury. ""He said everything would be OK,"" she said. She went to a bank ATM and withdrew $500 to give Wallace. ""I don't remember the dollar amount he asked for but I remember telling him that was the amount I could take out,"" she testified. Hours after Lloyd's death, Jenkins said, Hernandez appeared ""normal"" and his two alleged accomplices appeared ""fine."" Jenkins, 25, and Hernandez are the parents of a daughter who was just a year old when her father was arrested on June 26, 2013. Her sister Shaneah was dating Lloyd, 27, who was shot six times, according to prosecutors. At one point, McCauley asked Jenkins if she ever saw guns in the home. She told the jury that she saw one ""in the kitchen junk drawer."" Prosecution witnesses have testified that Lloyd was shot to death with a .45-caliber Glock handgun. McCauley approached Jenkins on the stand with a Glock similar to the one used in the murder. ""Is that a secured firearm?"" she asked, moving back slightly. ""Yes."" McCauley asked if the Glock's shape was similar to the one she saw in the junk drawer. ""Yes,"" she responded. ""Color?"" ""Yes."" Size? ""I'm not sure,"" she told the jury. Jenkins' testimony resumes next week. CNN's Lawrence Crook III and Susan Candiotti contributed to this report.","Aaron Hernandez is on trial in the death of Odin Lloyd .

Scroll down for video . Happy birthday, Sophia! Tamara Ecclestone and Jay Rutland celebrated daughter Sophia's first birthday by creating a farmyard for the tiny tot in the garden of their London mansion . Birthday girl: Tamara uploaded a snap of her firstborn wearing custom-made pyjamas on Instagram with the words: 'Happy birthday angel no words could ever describe how much I love you so proud of the beautiful little lady you are the light of my life' Zebras, sheep, puppies and ponies were just some of the animals that were seen arriving at the family home, which had been kitted out with pink balloons crafted into 'S' shapes in honour of the youngster. Each animal had its very own station complete with a gazebo and pink name sign and a balloon artist was also seen making his way into the family home. On Tuesday morning, Tamara uploaded a snap of her firstborn wearing custom-made pajamas on Instagram. The picture of the tiny tot wearing the outfit, which was emblazoned with her name and the number '1', was captioned with the words: 'Happy birthday angel no words could ever describe how much I love you so proud of the beautiful little lady you are the light of my life.' Fit for a princess: The entrance to the house was transformed into a balloon castle emblazoned with giant 'S' letters in the child's honour . Welcome to the farmyard: Each animal had its own station complete with a pink sign with its name on and a princess crown . Enjoying her special day: Tamara's little daughter Sophia seemed to be enjoying her special day in this Instagram shot of her playing with her new presents . Which was is the party? Guests and animal experts made their way into the event armed with little puppies on leads . Disneyland comes to London: Tamara even invited a real life princess along to join in the celebrations at her family home . Speaking about the event, Steven Duggan, who didn't organise this event but has organised events for the likes of Elton John and Adele, believes the event could have cost around £70,000. He said: 'This is a beautiful setting for Sophia on her birthday. 'We have done similar 1st birthday parties for high end clientele like Tamara Ecclestone before where our clients spent upwards of £70,000. It's a first birthday, if you can spoil them why not! It looks magical; a perfect fairytale party!'. Formerly of the party-girl persuasion, Tamara is embracing a more quiet life with open arms, confessing that 'parenting is so much better than going out partying'. And although Tamara  is clearly loving having a little girl, she does admit that it does come with its less-than-glamorous challenges. Speaking to new! magazine about the joys of being a parent, she admitted that there are moments that are rather embarrassing. 'After having a baby, all your dignity goes out of the window!' she joked, adding that some of her most mortifying moments in her first year of having a baby include 'breast leakage' and 'poo on her jeans'.

'The love that you feel is so much deeper,' she said. 'I don't have tolerance for bulls**t now. I don't waste time with fakeness. Sophia's my priority. She's really turned my life upside down – for the better.' The beautiful brunette socialite also opened up about the fact she and husband Jay Rutland are still sharing a bed with their tot, but that it's not a problem for them. Speaking in an interview with Hello magazine last year, Tamara - who gave birth to Sophia last March, her first child - revealed that she was a 'hands-on' mother even though she admitted it can be tiring. 'I'm totally exhausted all the time, but I don't care because it's a happy exhaustion,' she explained. 'I'm not drinking or having coffee and I'm being so healthy for Sophia. 'I'm sorry, but I'm completely obsessed with Sophia. I love her so much I'm like a crazy woman.' Tamara and her daughter were last week spotted enjoying a day out in Hyde Park, where they were duck spotting. Their little outing came just before Tamara and husband Jay and their daughter flew out to Milan for another of their many getaways, before also taking a 24-hour round-trip from the city to the glorious Lake Como in the north of Italy. Little Sophia was blissfully unaware of her luxury surrounding as she boarded a private plane with her mother. Jay, to whom Tamara has been married since 2013, chose to celebrate his 34th birthday with the quick getaway in the idyllic location, where they enjoyed a night at the Villa D’Este Hotel .

As its shadow engulfs the beach, the sheer size of the aircraft dwarfs the tourists underneath it, who pose for photographs and watch in awe. Seemingly closer than usual, the wheels look like they could be touched as turning heads follow its movement and numerous tablets and smart phones capture its landing. Passing the fence and arriving inside the airport, the plane’s wheels appear to narrowly miss a taxi, which drives on by as if nothing ever happened. Maho Beach is located on the Dutch side of the Caribbean island of Saint Martin, in the territory of Sint Maarten. Aircraft are forced to land so close to the beach so as to touch down near the start of the short Runway 10, which is 2,300 metres in length. As a result the area is popular with plane spotters and many of the surrounding bars and restaurants on the beach display airline departure and arrival timetables. Planes are required to fly low when approaching the airport so as to get as close to the start of the short Runway 10 .

The row was sparked by a sudden increase in the magazine's sales and revenue in the wake of the brutal attacks on January 7, according to the Times. It has reportedly made £21.6million since then after its usual circulation of 30,000-a-week rocketed to hundreds of thousands. Now the surviving staff members want that money and shares of the magazine - 40 per cent of which are owned by its murdered editor's parents - to be divided equally. Six of the Charlie Hebdo staff killed in Wednesday's attack are pictured together in this photo, taken in 2000. Circled top from left is Philippe Honore, Georges Wolinski, Bernard Maris and Jean Cabut. Below them on the stairs, from left, is editor Stephane Charbonnier and cartoonist Bernard 'Tignous' Verlhac . Terror: On January 7, brothers Said and Cherif Kouachi raided the Charlie Hebdo office in Paris and killed 11 people, sparking a string of terror attacks across the city . As many as 11 employees have instructed their lawyers to turn the magazine - which has published cartoons of the prophet Muhammad on its cover - into a workers' cooperative. It would mean they all have a stake in the company but their move has been attacked by another anonymous contributor in a leaked email to French news agency Agence France-Presse. The unnamed contributor accused the plotters of trying to grab the shares that belonged to the magazine's murdered editor Stephane Charbonnier 'before the worms have finished eating him'. 40 per cent of the company is owned by his parents, another 40 by the magazine's new editor Laurent Sourisseau and the final 20 per cent belongs to financial director Eric Portheault. One of the magazine's journalists Laurent Léger said: 'A new distribution of the capital would allow for the incredible influx of funds to the newspaper to be used in the most transparent manner possible.' And Patrick Pelloux - who writes a column for Charlie Hebdo - believes a co-operative would bind contributors to the newspaper. He said: 'When a company has been decimated, you feel completely tied to it. It is not a question of sharing the cake. The money does not interest us.' However a spokesman for Sourisseau and Portheault said: 'All this money is doing more harm than good. Greedy: An unnamed contributor has accused staff of trying to grab the shares that belonged to the magazine's murdered editor Stephane Charbonnier (pictured) 'before the worms have finished eating him' Demand: Since the brutal attack on Charlie Hebdo in January, the magazine's usual circulation of 30,000 a week has boomed to hundreds of thousands . 'It makes you think of those funerals where everyone is fighting over the grandmother's jewellery on the way back from the cemetery.' He added that the owners had promised not to pay themselves dividends for three years and wanted to ensure the £3million received in donations after the attack went to victims' families. 'We note the desire of the staff to be associated with the life of the newspaper. But we are a long way from thinking about the make-up of the shareholders.' This is not the first time that Charlie Hebdo has been split over financial matters. In 2008, it's then-editor Philippe Val faced a backlash when it emerged he paid himself dividends of over £200,000 when sale rose following the controversial publication of issues featuring the Propher Muhammad.","Staff instructed their lawyers to turn the magazine into a workers' cooperative .

The images, understood to have been taken in the terror group's de facto capital Raqqa, show the terrified young man being dragged out onto a public square in front of a bloodthirsty crowd. The blindfolded victim is forced to sit in a chair in the centre of the square, where he is held in place by one of the jihadis, while two others use a large meat cleaver to brutally sever his hand from his arm. Sick: The victim is seen pinned in a chair by a group of men, one of whom uses a chord to pull his arm taut while two others place a heavy meat cleaver on the top of his wrist, ready to strike . Horror: The images, understood to have been taken in ISIS' de facto capital Raqqa, show the terrified young man being led from a vehicle by three heavily armed terrorists, one of whom appears to be no older than 16 . The horrific images were shared on the Twitter page of the local  activist group Raqqa Is Being Slaughtered Silently, who work undercover in the city to expose the atrocities committed by ISIS. The four photographs are high quality shots and carry the distinctive yellow branding of ISIS' Al-Hayat Media Center, suggesting they may be stills from an as-yet unreleased propaganda video. The first image shows the blindfold and baseball cap-wearing victim being led from a vehicle by three heavily armed Islamic State terrorists, one of whom appears to be no older than 16. Another shot captures a bearded cleric appearing to read charges against the man - using a microphone and PA system to tell the crowd of sadistic onlookers that the man is accused of stealing. The victim is then seen pinned in a chair by a separate group of men, one of whom uses a chord to pull his arm taut while two others place a heavy meat cleaver on the top of his wrist, ready to strike. A final image shows the victim lying on his back in agony on a metal gurney while a man who appears to be a surgeon tends to the injury on his left hand. Accusations: A bearded cleric appears to read charges against the man - using a microphone and PA system to tell the gathered crowd of sadistic onlookers that the man has been accused of stealing . Painful: A final image shows the victim lying on his back in agony on a metal gurney while a man who appears to be a surgeon tends to the injury on his left hand . The video comes just one day after ISIS released gruesome footage of the murder of a man the terror group accused of working as a spy. The video was filmed in  Aleppo and shows a man believed to be named Ahmed Muhammad being led out to a forecourt by masked executioners, who then shoot him in the head multiple times at point blank range. In a chilling sign of ISIS' reach and influence, Muhammad is understood to have been accused of working as part of a secret spy network based  in neighbouring NATO member state Turkey before his brutal filmed execution over the border in Syria. Titled 'A Lesson To Be Learned', the three minute 40 second video has all the hallmarks of an official ISIS release - employing HD cameras, Hollywood-style sound and visual effects and slick editing and direction. It also carries the logo of one of the group's official Aleppo-based propaganda arms, Halab. The Islamic State cherry picks sections of the Koran and misinterprets the accounts of the Prophet Muhammad in order to wage jihad and sign up new recruits, experts say. It is estimated that 20,000 people have streamed into the territory in Iraq and Syria, where ISIS has proclaimed what it calls a 'caliphate', ruled by its often brutal version of Islamic law. The group purport to recreate the conquests and rule of the Prophet Muhammad and his successors and maintains its worst brutalities - such as beheading captives - only prove its purity in following what it contends is the prophet's example. But now Muslims clerics and other experts are speaking out, saying that the group hand picks what it wants from Islam's holy book, the Koran, and from accounts of Muhammad's actions and sayings, known as the Hadith. An ISIS member parades through the streets of Raqqa in Syria waving an Islamic State flag and brandishing a gun. Experts have now said that ISIS misinterprets the Koran in order to wage jihad . It then misinterprets many of these, while ignoring everything in the texts that contradicts those hand-picked selections. Writings by the group's clerics and its English-language online magazine, Dabiq, are full of citations from Koranic verses, the Hadith and centuries of interpreters, mostly from hardliners. But Joas Wagemakers, an assistant professor of Islamic Studies at Radboud University in the Netherlands, says these are taken far out of context by ISIS. He explained that Muslim scholars throughout history have used texts in a 'decontextualised way' to suit their purposes and says that ISIS represent the extreme. He added: 'It would be a mistake to conclude the Islamic State group's extremism is the true Islam that emerges from the Koran and Hadith.","Victim is dragged before bloodthirsty onlookers in the Syrian city of Raqqa .

abe98d249635957aa445df015a79241cf383bfc5,"Dame Jane Goodall has condemned politicians for pushing 'Frankenstein Food' Dame Jane Goodall, the renowned primate expert, has condemned ‘deluded’ politicians for pushing ‘Frankenstein Food’. The highly respected academic has endorsed a new book, which argues the companies responsible for developing genetically modified farming and food have twisted the evidence to minimise the dangers. Historically, critics of GM food have been lambasted by the GM companies, scientists who rely on their funding, and politicians, including the UK Government, as being ‘anti-science’. However, Dame Jane argues that the advocates of GM food have ignored evidence of harm with the result it is they who are guilty of being ‘anti-science’. The intervention is a powerful condemnation of the way biotech companies like Monsanto, Syngenta and Bayer, have forced GM crops and food on to dinner plates in the US without proper safety tests. And she is joining a growing campaign warning that Britain and Europe must not drop safeguards that have kept GM crops out. Dame Jane’s concerns have been raised in the foreword to a new book, ‘Altered Genes, Twisted Truth’, which is written by the American public interest lawyer, Steve Druker. Its publication comes as the US is seeing a growing backlash against GM. Just last week it emerged that the country’s favourite chocolate manufacturer, Hershey, is to drop GM from its products. Dame Jane said she has become appalled as what she calls a ‘shocking corruption of the life forms of the planet’. She said the GM process, which involves adding foreign genes to plants to create toxins to fend off insects or give them immunity to being sprayed with chemical pesticides has fundamentally changed them. However, she complains that supporters of the technology have committed a ‘fraud’ by trying to give the false impression that these new plants are essentially the same as those created by conventional plant breeding. She said: ‘This very real difference between GM plants and their conventional counterparts is one of the basic truths that biotech proponents have endeavoured to obscure. As part of the process, they portrayed the various concerns as merely the ignorant opinions of misinformed individuals – and derided them as not only unscientific, but anti-science. ‘They then set to work to convince the public and government officials, through the dissemination of false information, that there was an overwhelming expert consensus, based on solid evidence, that the new foods were safe. Yet this, as Druker points out, was clearly not true.’ Importantly, she claims, the companies have spread disinformation to try and win public support. ‘Druker describes how amazingly successful the biotech lobby has been – and the extent to which the general public and government decision makers have been hoodwinked by the clever and methodical twisting of the facts and the propagation of many myths. Moreover, it appears that a number of respected scientific institutions, as well as many eminent scientists, were complicit in this relentless spreading of disinformation.’ Dame Jane is considered to be the world’s foremost expert on chimpanzees. She is best known for her 55-year study of social and family interactions of wild chimpanzees in Gombe Stream National Park, Tanzania. She was made a Dame in 2004 and holds many other awards for her environmental and humanitarian work, including the Benjamin Franklin Medal in Life Science, the French Legion of Honour, the Benjamin Franklin Medal in Life Science, Japan’ s Kyoto Prize and the Tyler Prize for Environmental Achievement. The British government has signalled that it plans to use a new GM crop approval process to push ahead with growing the crops in this country. Separately, a new trade agreement between the EU and the USA, which is called TTIP, could make it much easier for GM foods from North America to appear on shelves here. However, Dame Jane warns it would be an enormous risk to accept the technology and describes Mr Druker as a hero worthy of a Nobel prize for lifting the lid on the truth about GM. Dame Jane endorsed a new book, which argues the companies responsible for developing genetically modified farming and food have twisted the evidence to minimise the dangers (file picture) She describes his work as one of the most important books of the last 50 years, and adds: ‘It will go a long way toward dispelling the confusion and delusion that has been created regarding the genetic engineering process and the foods it creates. ‘Although this book tells a story that’s in many ways distressing, it’s important that it has finally been told because so much confusion has been spread and so many important decision-makers have apparently been deluded.’ Mr Druker, who gave a press conference in London yesterday(wed), has challenged Britain’s Royal Society to apologies for its pro-GM stance and its part in rubbishing scientists who have safety doubts over the crops and food. His work points to research which has found tumours, liver and kidney harm in animals given GM feed in trials. And he complains, that researchers who dare to raise these problems have been pilloried. He said: ‘Contrary to the assertions of its proponents, the massive enterprise to reconfigure the genetic core of the world’s food supply is not based on sound science but on the systematic subversion of science – and it would collapse if subjected to an open airing of the facts.’ Pat Thomas, director of the campaigning group Beyond GM, warned the TTIP trade talks mean Britain and Europe could see a flood of biotech crops and food arriving here. She said: ‘Steven Druker’s investigation into the history of fraud and deceit that ushered in the era of GM deserves serious consideration before we take actions that will irreversibly alter the European food supply’. Dr Julian Little a spokesman for Bayer CropScience was not aware of Drunker's book. He said: 'We are now up to the three trillion meals and counting, that is meals containing GM ingredients, without a single substantial health issue since the beginning of the technology. 'There has been much dirt thrown but none of it has stuck.' On its website Monsanto say they place the 'highest priority' on the safety of their products and conduct 'rigorous and comprehensive testing on each.' They state: 'In fact, seeds with GM traits have been tested more than any other crops in the history of agriculture – with no evidence of harm to humans or animals. 'In addition, governmental regulatory agencies, scientific organizations and leading health associations worldwide agree on the safety of GM crops.' A spokesman for the company added: 'The denial of the safety of GM seeds and food ingredients is as baseless as the denial of clearly documented climate change. 'Countless peer-reviewed scientific studies performed with biotech crops — including more than 100 feeding studies — have confirmed their safety, as reflected in the respective safety assessments by regulatory authorities around the world.'","Dr Jane Goodall argues supporters of GM food ignored evidence of harm .

His conviction follows the sentencing of two other men, Noman Qureshi, 32, from Bradford, and Israr Khan, 35, from Luton, in October last year. They were sentenced to 21 and 18 years respectively. The smugglers did not realise they were already under surveillance by a crack team from the National crime Agency soon after the container ship arrived at the port in Suffolk in December 2013 . On the evening of Friday 6 December 2013, Qureshi drove from his home in Bradford, picked up Khan in Luton, and drove to a hotel in Ilford. Sami arrived in his Porsche 911 to meet with them to discuss where to unload the heroin from the car. The Jaguar, which had been shipped to the UK from Pakistan, was driven on the back of a low-loader to an address in Dagenham during the early hours of 7 December . Qureshi and Khan met it, but shortly after left the scene. They were arrested later that morning in Luton. The Jaguar was seized and examined by specialist Border Force search officers. They recovered 316 separate packages of heroin totalling 230 kilos. If cut and sold the drugs would have had a likely potential street value of £37.2 million. Sami was arrested in February 2014. NCA investigators linked him to a phone that had regularly been used to contact Qureshi prior to the heroin importation. The Class A drug was packed into the boot (pictured), dashboard, central console and spare wheel compartment. Even the car's engine had been removed to make room for the lucrative haul . Black packages of heroin appear to be concealed inside the back seats, removed by police . Paperwork with the vehicle made out it had been shipped to the UK to be repaired. But investigators were able to find the drugs after the Jaguar was scanned with X-ray equipment, and its secret cargo was revealed . Jailed: Noman Qureshi of Bradford, West Yorkshire (right), was jailed for 21 years and Israr Khan of Luton, Bedfordshire (left) was given an 18-year sentence. Police said they were part of an international crime group . National Crime Agency Branch Commander David Norris said: 'Sami played a crucial part in this conspiracy - his role would have been to recover the drugs concealed within the car. 'This group had international contacts and planned to import hundreds of kilos of high-purity heroin to the UK in what was a quite remarkable smuggling attempt. 'The car in which the drugs were hidden had virtually every spare bit of space filled with heroin. 'But they were unaware their moves were being monitored by NCA investigators, who prevented them from putting these harmful drugs on the streets.'","Attique Sami was third member of drug smuggling crime gang to be jailed .

The 35-year-old midfielder, who has played more games than any player in Barca’s history and won every honour possible, will join Manchester City’s MLS franchise at the end of this season ready to start playing for them in 2016. Xavi (centre) celebrates after collecting the second of his three Champions League medals in 2009 . The veteran midfielder (left) has only been a bit-part player under Luis Enrique this season at Barca . Spanish radio station Cadena SER reported on Wednesday that the player, his father Joaquín and his agent Ivan Corretja met with a representative from the club at the L'Arrosseria Xàtiva restaurant in Barcelona just a stone’s throw from the Nou Camp to negotiate his move to the US. Xavi looked set to leave Barcelona last summer but decided to stay for one more season after a conversation with coach Luis Enrique. Despite that commitment he has played only a small role this campaign and played no part in Barcelona’s 2-1 victory over Manchester City last week. His departure from Barcelona will mark the end of an era. He joined the club as an 11-year-old and went on to make more than 700 appearances. He has won seven La Liga titles and three Champions Leagues. Xavi's former Barcelona team-mate David Villa (above) is already at New York City . Ex-England midfielder Frank Lampard is unveiled at the new MLS franchise in July 2014 . It was Pep Guardiola who famously said of the young midfielder he saw coming through Barcelona’s youth system: ‘This player will retire me’. He ended up playing alongside him briefly before leaving the club and returning to build a team around the Spain star who also played 133 times for his country. Xavi's signing for New York City is a major coup and will also reunite him with former Spain and Barcelona team-mate David Villa, who will be expected to thrive on the service offered him by Xavi, and Lampard who also joins the MLS new boys after winning 11 major trophies at Chelsea in a 13-year period.","Xavi's Barcelona contract expires in the summer .

The Republic of Ireland manager said it would be understandable for some of his squad to be lacking in confidence but stressed the importance of being fully focused when the Group D leaders arrive in Dublin. O’Neill has had to contend with a couple of injuries to personnel already this week — Darron Gibson sat out training again with a groin complaint while James McClean will go for a scan on an ankle problem — while also attempting to boost the morale of players currently feeling the heat at their clubs.

John O'Shea has suffered a dismal season and is involved in a relegation fight with Sunderland . James McClean (right) is an injury doubt and will have a scan on his ankle before making a decision . ‘That’s the nature of it, I wouldn’t get too concerned,’ said O’Neill. ‘Someone asked me quite rightly about whether I’d be concerned about three or four players going into the side and of course you would, it would stand to reason. It is what it is. ‘I wouldn’t be too concerned, though. The players are up, ready to go, there’s a good enthusiasm around them. ‘A month or six weeks ago you start to formulate a few plans but you know those disappear when you pick up a few injuries along the way or maybe some people have a bit of club form. ‘Some players are coming in absolutely fine form, others have had trials and tribulations at club level which is a bit of a concern but I think put that to the side, just think of us. ‘Just think of the game ahead. If you are coming in great form, then fantastic. If it’s not, then don’t worry.’ Sunderland’s John O’Shea and Aston Villa’s Ciaran Clark are in a Premier League relegation fight and even though Everton trio Seamus Coleman, James McCarthy and Gibson won last week, the Toffees remain close to the drop zone.

So we’ll try and do a wee bit of that in the course of the week. ‘We’re training at the Aviva [today] and that should be good. It will give us a feeling about it again.’ On the injury front, O’Neill also revealed that Gibson is ‘concerned’ by his groin problem and that Stephen Ward did not have an operation on his ankle and will have a second scan before determining his plan of action.

Bad weather  prevented the recovery of bodies and the flight recorder from the wreckage on Thursday, and while the military had not officially released any times, loved one of those on the doomed copter did speak with the press.. Now however, the names and identities of the seven Marines have been revealed. Scroll down for video . Crews lower a piece of a Black Hawk helicopter onto a barge in the Santa Rosa Sound near Pritchard Point in Florida . Staff Sgt. Andrew C. Seif (left) and Staff Sgt. Trevor P. Blaylock (right) Staff Sgt. Andrew C. Seif was a Silver Star Medal recipient who received the award for facing enemy fire to save a mortally wounded friend in Afghanistan in July 2012. He was born in Fairbanks, Alaska, and lived in Albuquerque, New Mexico, until middle-school when his family moved to Holland, Michigan, the Marines said. Seif, 26, grew up playing soldier in his backyard and joined the Marines just weeks after graduating from high school, according to an article about his award published this week in the Camp Lejeune Globe, the post newspaper. By 2012, he had spent two years as a special forces operator with the 2nd Marine Special Operations Battalion, which operates from the Middle East to Central Asia. Seif and his teammate, Sgt. Justin Hansen, were closing in on one of western Afghanistan's bomb experts, according to the paper. They came under fire, and Hansen was hit. Seif moved Hansen to safer position and treated his teammate's wounds. Seif returned fire, advanced alone across the compound and found the targeted bomb-maker. 'The fact that (Seif) continued to fight through the objective to get Sgt. Hansen taken care of, putting himself in the line of fire, speaks volumes to who he is and demonstrates that he would never leave a Marine behind,' said Maj. Gen. Joseph L. Osterman. Seif's wife was at his side when he received the medal. Staff Sgt. Trevor P. Blaylock, 29, was born in Lake Orion, Michigan, and swam on the varsity swim team. He attended Henry Ford Community College for one year before joining the Marine Corps in 2006. Initially, he was a mechanic in an armored reconnaissance battalion at Camp Pendleton in California. He served two tours in Iraq in 2007 and 2008. His decorations include the Navy and Marine Corps Commendation Medal with Valor. His home near Camp Lejeune was within earshot of dull booming sounds of artillery or other heavy weapons. Master Sgt. Thomas A. Saunders (left) and Staff Sgt. Liam Flynn (right) Born in Bonn, Germany, Master Sgt. Thomas A. Saunders, 33, enlisted in the Marines after graduating from high school in Virginia. Following basic training in 1999, he was assigned to Camp LeJeune. He deployed to Kosovo and served with special operations teams in Iraq and Afghanistan before years before joining a Marine Corps special operations unit in 2010. He spent eight months as a liaison to Army Special Operations Command before joining his Middle East-focused regiment four years ago. He was married to a fellow Marine based at Camp Lejeune, and the couple has one son, according to an award by the Marine Corps Association & Foundation naming Saunders its special forces operator of 2014. Born in Reading, England, Staff Sgt. Liam Flynn, 33, moved to Queens, New York in 2002. He enlisted in the Marine Corps in 2006. After boot camp, he was assigned to Camp Lejeune. He served tours of duty in Iraq and Afghanistan before joining the Marine Corps' special operations force in 2011 and returning to Afghanistan in 2012. Flynn's heroism was honored by receiving three Navy and Marine Corps Achievement Medals with Valor and the Bronze Star with Valor. Capt. Stanford Henry Shaw III (left) and Staff Sgt. Marcus S. Bawol (right) Capt. Stanford Henry Shaw III, 31, was from Basking Ridge, New Jersey, and attended Ridge High School, where he was student government president and captain of the varsity lacrosse team. He attended the United States Naval Academy and became a commissioned Marine officer upon graduation in 2006. He graduated from the Infantry Officer Course and was assigned to the 1st Battalion, 7th Marines. He served two tours of duty in Iraq in 2007 and 2009, according to information provided by the Marines at Camp Lejeune. His career took him to Japan, where he became the deputy camp commander of a jungle warfare training center on Okinawa in 2011. He graduated from the Malaysian army's jungle warfare course and then joined the Marine special forces. Staff Sgt. Marcus S. Bawol of Warren, Michigan, ""loved everything about the military,"" said his sister, Brandy Peek. 'He couldn't wait to join. He wanted to fight for our country and was always striving to be the best Marine he could be,' Peek said. The 27-year-old graduated in 2006 from Warren Mott High School. Bawol played baseball and football and was a member of the school's swim team, according to district Superintendent Robert Livernois. Bawol attended Olivet College for a year, where he was a catcher on the baseball team. He had planned to marry his fiancée in October, Peek said.

He really got into that, the wrestling and playing. He'd carry them around on his back,' said his sister-in-law, Lora Waraksa. He was a ""proud Marine, a loving husband and most wonderful father,"" she said. He also loved golfing and the ocean — he often took his nephews out to hunt for sea shells. Born in Memphis, Tennessee, Kemp met his wife, Jenna, at Port Washington High School in Wisconsin, where he was voted ""best smile"" by his senior class. He graduated in 2005. He started as an artillery mechanic, and his military merit led to three quick promotions. He completed training in special operations in 2012 and spent seven months in Afghanistan before returning in June. Meanwhile, divers have found the wreckage of the military helicopter in just 25 feet of water. A small memorial stands in the sand along Highway 98 in Navarre, Florida . 'It was certainly a high-impact crash,' said Eglin Fire Chief Mark Giuliano, and 'very, very, very dense fog' was complicating the response. There's almost no visibility at the spot where the wreckage was found, forcing search crews to move slowly to avoid colliding with each other, and the surf is too rough still to pull the wreckage to the surface. Dozens of airmen walked the shores of Santa Rosa Sound Thursday, recovering pieces of clothing and bits of wreckage, but the U.S. Coast Guard suspended its search Thursday afternoon, and will instead focus on helping the Army recover the remaining fuselage and debris, it said. President Barack Obama has promised a thorough investigation into the cause, which is being led by the U.S. Army Combat Readiness Center out of Fort Rucker, Alabama. The helicopter went down Tuesday night in fog so thick that another helicopter turned back. American flags stand in the median near the bridge entrance to Navarre Beach, Florida . A woman at campground nearby, Kim Urr, said she heard a metallic sound and then two muffled explosions as it disappeared into the narrow waterway separating Santa Rosa Island from the Florida panhandle mainland. This dense sea fog, which could persist through Friday, is common when warm southern air meets cold water this time of year, said Jack Cullen, a National Weather Service meteorologist in Mobile, Alabama. The same fog enveloped a large gathering holding a vigil on a pier Wednesday night. Crashing Gulf waves created a somber backdrop to the songs, tears and prayers of the people, who have strong ties to the military and the sprawling Eglin Air Force Base. 'My heart is really hurt right now knowing these people were here just on training - knowing they went and left their family members and did not give that goodbye, you know, because they weren't going off to war,' said a tearful Dolly Edwards, herself the wife of a Marine.","The identities of the seven Marines killed in a helicopter crash off the coast of Florida this week have been revealed .

788fd4b82375fa3cf5cbe3ef6fcbacbc693a0a3c,"(CNN)Lee Kuan Yew will forever be remembered as the man who transformed a mosquito-ridden colonial trading post into a prosperous financial center with clean streets, shimmering skyscrapers and a stable government. Born in 1923, Lee became Prime Minister in 1959 when Singapore, a tiny spit of land with no natural resources and a polyglot population of Chinese, Malays and Indians, was still British territory and beset by riots and unrest. He presided over Singapore's bitter split from Malaysia in 1965 and molded the independent country into the global economic powerhouse it is today. ""I was trying to create, in a third-world situation, a first-world oasis,"" Lee told CNN in 2008. READ MORE: Obama: 'Lee a visionary' Lee's thinking also had an international impact. His brand of capitalism -- which stresses the role of government rather than the free hand of the market -- has provided a blueprint for China's landmark economic reforms. But Lee was also a divisive figure, attracting criticism for stifling media freedom and for the harsh treatment of political opponents. In 2013, protests over plans to allow more immigrants into the city-state indicated growing unease among Singaporeans about the vision of the country set forth by the People's Action Party -- the party co-founded by Lee that has ruled Singapore for five decades. Lee voluntarily stepped down as Prime Minister in 1990, the first Asian strongman to do so. However, he played a role in the country's Cabinet until 2011 when his eldest son, Lee Hsien Loong, was elected for a second term as prime minister. The elder Lee retained his influence around the world. ""This is one of the legendary figures of Asia in the 20th and 21st centuries,"" U.S. President Barack Obama said during a meeting with Lee at the White House in October 2009. ""He is somebody who helped to trigger the Asian economic miracle,"" Obama added. But there were indications Lee's health had been slipping in recent years. In 2010 he was admitted to the hospital with a chest infection and in early 2013, Lee -- then 89 -- was hospitalized and treated treated for ""stroke-like symptoms."" He was again admitted to the hospital on February 5 for severe pneumonia and more than six weeks later remained on a ventilator. A fourth-generation Singaporean, Lee's family originally emigrated from southern China. A bright student, he gained a place in the city's elite Raffles Institution and went on to study law at Fitzwilliam College at Cambridge. He attributed his decision to go into politics to his experiences during the Japanese occupation of Singapore. ""I learned how people survived and how people had to submit because you need to eat and your family needs to live, so I learned the meaning of power,"" he told CNN in 2002. The city Lee took control of in 1959 was still recovering from the ravages of war and could not have been more different from today's Singapore. However, Lee told CNN he had no ""great vision of transformation."" He concentrated on attracting investment and creating jobs; first finding a successful niche in electronics manufacturing by touting Singapore as an alternative to Hong Kong, which he said was in turmoil due to the Cultural Revolution in China. While Lee has been lauded for his economic accomplishments, he also created a Singapore bound by stringent laws and regulations that dictated most, if not all, aspects of society -- including media and political freedoms, censorship and even the selling of chewing gum. The country ranks 150th in Reporters Without Borders' 2014 Media Freedom Index, putting it just above the Democratic Republic of Congo, Mexico and Iraq. The New York Times, The Economist, the International Herald Tribune and the Asian Wall Street Journal have all been targeted with the ""judicial harassment"" employed by the Lee family, according to the media watchdog. In a 2014 article for CNN, opposition politician Dr. Chee Soon Juan criticized Singapore's authoritarian system, blaming a lack of dissenting views for economic inequality and worsening working conditions. ""The ranks of the opposition, civil society and labor movement have been decimated in the last 50 years through imprisonment without trial and criminal prosecution, and nearly every newspaper, TV channel and radio station is owned and run by the state,"" Chee said. But in a 2008 interview with CNN's Fareed Zakaria, Lee rebuffed charges that Singapore was too domineering or coercive a state. ""I want social peace and stability within the country. I am not following any prescription given to me by any theoretician on democracy,"" he said. While Lee is likely to be remembered with affection and pride by many Singaporeans, a younger generation, with no memory of the poverty and violence that marked the country's birth, is questioning the Lee dynasty's control of Singaporean politics and pushing for greater democracy. In 2011, the People's Action Party lost six seats to the opposition, prompting Lee, then the party's ""minister mentor"" and another former prime minister, Goh Chok Tong, to resign. In a joint letter to parliament, the two explained they ""decided to leave the Cabinet and have a completely younger team of ministers to connect to and engage with this young generation in shaping the future of our Singapore."" How Singapore copes with these democratic demands will be key to its success in its second half-century, but those demands are unlikely to detract from Lee's achievements in its first 50 years.  In 2010, Time magazine listed Lee as one of world's 100 most influential people. ""The mark of a great leader is to take his society from where it is to where it has never been,"" wrote former U.S. Secretary of State Henry Kissinger in the article on Lee. ""There is no better strategic thinker in the world today.""","Lee Kuan Yew became Prime Minister in 1959 .

Christine Hà, an American chef, writer and blogger from Houston, Texas, has released an inspiring video tutorial showing how she applies her make-up with a tried-and-tested formula. Christine Hà, who lost her sight in 2007, has released an inspiring video tutorial showing how she applies her make-up without a mirror . Christine, 35, who has a video series on YouTube called 'Blind Life of Christine Ha', explains that she decided to release a beauty tutorial after a lot of people asked her how a visually impaired person does their own make-up. The chef, who was the first blind contestant of MasterChef and won the show in 2012, said: 'I remember back when I was filming Masterchef we had to do our own hair and make-up. 'I would sit and put on my own make-up and a lot of my friends on the show would watch me in awe because I don't use a mirror.' The chef, who was the first blind contestant of MasterChef and won the show in 2012, said her fellow contestants would watch her doing her make-up in awe because she didn't use a mirror .

Christine, who suffers from neuromyelitis optica, whereby her immune system attacked the optic nerves and spinal cord, explains that she will demonstrate her daily wear make-up. 'The first thing is foundation,' she begins. 'Now I am in my 30s, I've been told we have to worry more about redness on our skin so I have started wearing it. Brush it all on, which helps it blend really well so I don't have to worry too much about streaks. 'As you can see, I am covering the area around my nose where I get the most redness, or so I've been told.' She then takes a pair of eyelash curlers and says: 'A lot of people think this is scary because I can't see, but I can feel the eyelash curler so I know that I have it pressed up against my eyelid.' She admits that applying mascara is 'very tricky', but, she says, once you know how long the wand is, you know where to put your hand . While she waits for her mascara to dry, she puts on her blush across the apple of her cheeks . She then takes her mascara, which she says is 'very tricky', but, she says, once you know how long the wand is, you know where to put your hand. She explains: 'You approach you lashes very gently and once you feel the brush on your lashes, you know to start stroking it on. I do two layers on both eyes.' While she waits for her mascara to dry, she puts on her blush. 'I do about five swirls across my face and always tap before I put it on to get rid of excess,' she says. Next, she applies lip liner, which she says she also does  by feel. Lastly, she applies eyeliner. She finally applies lipliner and lipstick, which she says she does by feel . She says: 'Some people may think it's backwards to do your eyeliner last but I want to make sure my mascara is dry because I can't see if it smudges. 'This can be tricky so I anchor my hands against my face so I can have more control of the pencil. I look up and start in the outer corner and draw in a few gentle line strokes. 'I don't like to go all the way into my inner corner because this helps make your eyes look a little bigger.'

The 35-year-old wasn't celebrating a cup triumph but the millions flowing through his accounts from an alleged £30million investment scheme that snared a string of top-flight players. Pictures have now emerged of McIndoe in 2011 - at the height of his scheme - surrounded by beautiful women and empty champagne bottles as he revelled in a millionaire playboy's lifestyle in Marbella with a limitless credit card and wads of cash.

McIndoe (second from the right) parties in Marbella using money earned from the elaborate scheme . McIndoe started out at Luton Town, making his debut in 1998 and playing for the Hatters 39 times before joining Hereford on a free in 2000. Yeovil then took advantage of the Bulls' financial plight and snapped him up for £25,000 the following year. He scored 22 goals in 91 outings for the Glovers, winning promotion from the Conference in 2003 before joining Doncaster for £50,000. McIndoe twice made the PFA Team of the Year with Rovers and was his side's joint-top scorer in 2004-05 with 12 goals. He twice represented the Scotland B side during his time at Rovers. After a loan spell at Derby he joined Barnsley then Wolves, on loan again, before the deal was made permanent for £250,000. He signed a three-year contract with Bristol City in 2007 and scored the winner against Crystal Palace in the second leg of the 2008 Championship play-off semi-final. They lost out to Hull at Wembley and McIndoe had one more season at Ashton Gate before joining Coventry. He also had a brief loan stint at MK Dons. But the former Wolves and Coventry midfielder, who is accused of persuading 300 stars including Jimmy Bullard as well as a string of lower league players to invest with him, is now being investigated by police. He was forced into a bankruptcy court with debts approaching £3m earlier this month where he claimed to be penniless and living on the charity of friends and family. The Metropolitan Police are investigating and have started quizzing victims and associates. 'He was the Mr Big in Marbella, buying loads of champagne and girls all over the place. He even had a bodyguard,' said one footballer, who lost around £75,000 in the scheme, which promised a 20 per cent return on investments. McIndoe, from Edinburgh, hired pop star Alexandra Burke to perform at a party and invested in a private members club, in London. But it was in Marbella that McIndoe indulged the lavish lifestyle - shown in these exclusive photos - he could not afford as his playing career ended in non-league football. He hired a modernist £2m mansion for £27,000-a-week for a three-week holiday spree and spent £40,000 on champagne in one day at a beach club party. Friends had bottles of champagne and vodka at their tables whenever they went to nightclubs. McIndoe celebrates scoring for Doncaster against Arsenal in the League Cup in 2005 .

The former Scotland B player rented a £27,000-a-week mansion for a three-week holiday in Spain . 'There were lots of girls and lots of drink,' said the player, who had been befriended by McIndoe when he was a young apprentice at the same club. 'He was spending money like you've never seen before.' McIndoe was photographed lounging on a white sofa with his then girlfriend, model Emma Frain, and smoking a huge cigar while surrounded by friends as he bankrolled their luxury holidays. The player added that McIndoe targeted fellow professionals and businessmen football supporters and initially gave them the 20 per cent return paid monthly in cash. The scheme sucked in around 300 players and the former QPR and Hull star Bullard is thought to have lost around £600,000 which prompted him to go on the ITV reality show, I'm A Celebrity Get Me Out of Here. He told original investors to get other 'clients' involved and they would be rewarded.

McIndoe lived at the five-star Mayfair Hotel, paying £4,000 a week for a suite, and also rented a Belgravia apartment for an upfront £150,000 annual fee, it is alleged. He ran glitzy parties at celebrity nightclubs including Funky Buddha, in London, and drove around in a Bentley and a Maybach. He was reportedly gambling heavily before the scheme crashed and is said to have run through £1m on bets with one bookmaker in a year. 'He had the gift of the gab but was very cagey about the scheme, saying the money was in property, gold or City investments,' added the player, who declined to be named. 'People were convinced when they saw him paying out but then he suddenly closed the scheme down. He kept telling me to wait and that I would be a wealthy man.' McIndoe celebrates sinking Crystal Palace to reach Wembley in 2008 . But he was consoled by Wayne Brown after Bristol City lost the 2008 Championship Play-off final to Hull . Another person to have been caught out by the former Scotland B international was glamour model Georgia Eden, who was one of 30 women hired to attend club nights organised by McIndoe. In total, McIndoe was due to pay the model agency who organised the women £12,000, but the money never materialised. Speaking to the Daily Record, Eden said: 'We were asked to mingle around and talk to guests in the club. The organisers said they were really pleased with what we had done and we were told we would be paid within 30 days. Georgia Eden was one of 30 models hired to attend a event put on at a club by McIndoe . But Eden, along with her colleagues, was never paid for her work with the agency said to be owed £12,000 . McIndoe (right) in action playing for his former club Wolves against West Bromwich Albion in 2007 . 'That date came and went and a lot of excuses were made to the agency. 'To have that amount of girls booked for one job was a really big deal so it was a big let down to not be paid for the work we had done.' McIndoe was made bankrupt in October last year with disclosed debts of £2.4m. He told the London bankruptcy court this month that he had no income and was living off £13,900 surplus from the sale of his mother's house but £6,000 of that had been given to his girlfriend, who lives in Epping, Essex. 'That money has been running thin of late so I have been getting help from friends and family,' he told the hearing. He added that he was not working and was living with his mother in Edinburgh or staying with a friend in London. After the hearing, he faced accusations from creditors that he had not responded to their questions about repayment. 'I have nothing to say, I cannot comment about this,' he said. The hearing was adjourned until March 25 and he must attend a meeting with the bankruptcy trustee later this month.

9e63922c8f598adeaa632d45d804ca8419609f17,"Great artworks sometimes come in an unexpected form. A Chinese university professor has created a series of vivid portraits of well-known figures using tiny pieces of jeans, reported the People's Daily Online. The largest of all, an image of a Buddha, measures two metres (6.6ft) in height and comprises more than 10,000 pieces of denim. Wang Xiaolei, an associate professor at Wuhan Textile University, started creating what he calls ‘denim paintings’ after visiting a town in China in 2007 which specialised in processing off-cut cloth pieces but had a terrible effect on the surrounding environment in doing so. Creativity: Wang Xiaolei, working on a portrait of Audrey Hepburn, embarked on the unusual endeavour of 'painting' with unwanted denim after witnessing how scrap cloth factories destroy the environment . Variety: Mr Wang's paintings cover a wide range of figures from Chairman Mao to David Beckham (centre) Vividness: The professor's interpretation of Zhang Yimo (left), a famous Chinese film director, and Mo Yan (right), a Nobel Prize-winning Chinese author . His interest was strengthen after an academic visit to the University of Manchester in 2008, during which he learned more ways of recycling scrap cloth. Since then, Mr Wang has collected tens of thousands of old jeans for experimenting with his art. He says denim has a three-dimensional quality so it is easy to make shapes with. To make a portrait, he first cuts jeans into large pieces and separates these pieces into different colour shadings. Then he goes into a trail-and-error stage of setting out the outlines and establishing the different shades of colours of the particular picture, and this could take more than 100 alterations to get right. Fashion: Mr Wang's unique style has created a trend among his students at Wuhan Textile University who regularly paint with him in the studio. In this picture, he is holding a portrait of Andy Lau, a renowned singer and actor from Hong Kong . Process: The professor first cuts jeans into large pieces and separates these pieces into different colour shadings, before creating artworks of figures such as Leonardo DiCaprio (left) Effort: To set the correct outlines and colour tones of a painting sometimes takes more than 100 alterations . Mr Wang creates portraits of a range of Chinese and international figures, including Chairman Mao, Fan Bingbing, David Beckham, Michael Jackson, Audrey Hepburn and Leonardo Dicaprio. His wife Taohui, who also collaborates on him with his ‘denim painting’, says Mr Wang is so absorbed in his work that he spent one New Year’s eve in his studio. Extended periods of concentration on these denim collages, separating the cloth into almost identical shades of colour, has also resulted in his eyes almost always being bloodshot. Mr Wang’s hard work finally paid off when his paintings attracted the attention of a director of the Cultural University of Japan, who invited the denim warrior to hold an exhibition in Japan. He has also produced portraits for the eight invited guest speakers at the World Textile Conference last November. Devotion: Mr Wang's wife says her husband is so absorbed in his work that he spent one New Year's Eve in his studio .

3d3605febbd6c708b9f5d25882d2facc9726e689,"Obama, pictured on Wednesday, made his first remarks on Ferguson police's racial discrimination . President Obama said the type of racial discrimination found in Ferguson, Missouri, is not unique to that police department, and he cast law enforcement reform as a chief struggle for today's civil rights movement. Obama said improving civil rights and civil liberties with police is one of the areas that 'requires collective action and mobilization' 50 years after pivotal civil rights marches brought change to the country. The president made his first remarks about this week's Justice Department report of racial bias in Ferguson, which found officers routinely discriminating against blacks by using excessive force. The Justice Department refused to prosecute Ferguson cop Darren Wilson despite compiling a 350,000-page report on racial profiling in the Missouri city which 'led to' him fatally shooting unarmed black teen Michael Brown on August 9, 2014. 'I don't think that is typical of what happens across the country, but it's not an isolated incident,' Obama told The Joe Madison Radio Show on Sirius XM radio's Urban View channel. 'I think that there are circumstances in which trust between communities and law enforcement have broken down, and individuals or entire departments may not have the training or the accountability to make sure that they're protecting and serving all people and not just some.' Obama's interview was to preview his trip Saturday to Selma, Alabama, where he plans to speak from the Edmund Pettus Bridge, where white police officers beat civil rights protesters on March 7, 1965. Obama last visited Selma in 2007, when he was running for the Democratic presidential nomination and spoke about the responsibility of those who came after the civil rights generation of the '60s to carry on the struggle. It was a theme he reiterated ahead of his return visit. In another interview with radio host Tom Joyner, Obama said that despite the progress in race relations over the past 50 years, the Justice Department findings about Ferguson show that civil rights 'is an unfinished project.' 'There is work to be done right now,' he said. On Friday, Obama was kicking off the weekend's 50th anniversary with a town hall meeting at South Carolina's Benedict College, a historically black college. The White House said Obama plans to speak about efforts young people made throughout history to expand opportunity. Obama's visit to Columbia is his first trip to South Carolina as president. Obama has just two other states to reach his goal of traveling to all 50 in office - South Dakota and Utah. Catalyst: The Justice Department began the civil rights investigation following the August shooting of Michael Brown (left), an unarmed black 18-year-old, by white police officer Darren Wilson (right) The Justice Department report of bias in Ferguson that came out this week revealed that 88 per cent of people against whom police used excessive force were African-American (a protester pictured on August 15 last year during a demonstration)","Obama said that there are places where trust between police and the communities they serve has broken down .

64cece9fc20a75f517847eccd2c6a586248a49de,"It was just over two months ago that McDonald's released an advertisement stating it 'will never be kale'. But it seems the fast food giant may be having a change of heart regarding the trendy super food, with a new report suggesting that McDonald's plans to introduce kale to its menu soon. Janney Capital Markets restaurant analysts wrote that 'one of our industry sources indicates that McDonald's U.S. plans to roll out kale as an ingredient in its restaurants at some point in the not-too-distant future.' Scroll down for video . McHipster? Despite running this ad just weeks ago, it's been reported that McDonald's will begin to offer kale on its menu in the near future . Janney analyst Mark Kalinowski told CNN the move could mean kale salads and even smoothies may be on the horizon and said the company's goal is to appear healthier or of a higher quality. 'McDonald's clearly aims to raise consumers' perception of the quality of its food. Adding kale to the menu in some way could help be a step in this direction,' he wrote. However, McDonald's stayed mum when questioned about the superfood, telling CNN, in part: 'we're always looking at new and different ingredients.' Either way, don't expect your future Big Macs to be piled with the curly greens. Six weeks ago, the fast food mega chain debuted a commercial in which the words 'WILL NEVER BE KALE' appeared in block letters over the signature burger's lettuce layer. The news comes after McDonald's on Monday vowed to remake itself as a 'modern, progressive burger company' after aggressive competition from Chipotle, Chick-fil-A and myriad 'better burger' chains bit into U.S. restaurant sales last month. February ended the run of former Chief Executive Don Thompson. His short tenure included 2014, when falling profit, revenue and traffic resulted in one of McDonald's worst years in decades. Steve Easterbrook, a McDonald's insider who led two UK-based restaurant chains before returning to the company in 2013, took the helm at the Golden Arches on March 1. Leafy: The trendy vegetable would likely be offered in the form of salads and smoothies, say analysts . Moving on up: Reports of the new McMenu item come just after the company's announced intention Monday to become a more 'modern, progressive burger company' The company that virtually invented fast food has struggled to find the right recipe to meet diners' growing appetite for healthier, fresher food. In his first big move as CEO, Easterbrook last week announced that McDonald's USA will switch to chicken raised with fewer antibiotics. The policy, which will affect McNuggets and other products sold in its roughly 14,000 U.S. stores, will put McDonald's more in step with Chipotle and Chick-fil-A. McDonald's shares were up 0.8 percent at $97.90 at midday. The stock is up about 10 percent since Easterbrook's promotion was announced in late January. Sales at U.S. restaurants open at least 13 months dropped a steeper-than-expected 4 percent in February, contributing to the 1.7 percent decline in global sales for the month. Analysts, on average, had expected a 0.7 percent fall for the United States and a 0.3 percent drop worldwide, according to research firm Consensus Metrix. February sales results from Europe were slightly better than expected, but the unit that includes Asia continued to struggle with the after-effects of a supply chain scandal last year. McDonald's has been trimming complicated menus to speed up service; giving restaurant operators more control over aspects including regional food choices; testing customized burgers and sandwiches to compete with Chipotle, Subway and other popular restaurants; and tweaking advertising to emphasize 'Lovin,' a play on the company's ubiquitous 'I'm lovin' it' tagline. Still, one pension fund adviser on Monday renewed its call for McDonald's to shake up its board. 'Today's disappointing numbers underscore the widespread reforms McDonald's requires ... and these changes must go beyond new management to include refreshing its stale and insular board,' said Dieter Waizenegger, executive director of the CtW Investment Group, which advises union pension funds that hold a small percentage of McDonald's shares.","A Big Mac ad that debuted in January pasted the words 'will never be kale' over the signature burger's lettuce .

d86727012f39a4b7c69c3c4a4c58b08612a0cc25,"The head of the Catholic church in England today said he was 'dismayed' that immigration is a major concern for voters ahead of the general election. Cardinal Vincent Nichols, the Archbishop of Westminster, insisted parts of Britain would 'grind to a halt' without immigrants, the vast majority of whom 'work hard and make a very positive contribution'. David Cameron's promise to cut net migration to the tens of thousands was left in tatters last week when it emerged the figure reached almost 300,000 in the year to September. Cardinal Vincent Nichols, the Archbishop of Westminster, insisted parts of Britain would 'grind to a halt' with immigrants, the vast majority of whom 'work hard and make a very positive contribution' Mr Cameron has admitted that his failure to fulfil his pledge has fuelled public concern about the numbers of people moving to the UK. In a letter sent to Catholic churches across the country, the Church's bishops warn: 'There is a great danger of blaming immigrants for the ills of society.' Cardinal Nichols told BBC One's Andrew Marr show that 'every party has to be tested on its approach to immigration'. 'No government in the last three decades has solved the problem of immigration, so it is a really difficult issue.' Asked if he was dismayed that immigration is such a big issue in the election, he replied: 'Well I am because I do think we need to go back and say what is our stance towards the world around us? 'Do we see ourselves genuinely as a player, as a contributor wanting to build something that is better for everybody?' Net long-term migration to the UK was estimated to be 298,000 in the year ending September 2014, a major rise on the 210,000 figure a year earlier . Mr Cameron has claimed that cutting immigration to the levels seen in the 1980s would mean it would cease to be a major political issue . Polling data shows the level of public concern about immigration is higher when the numbers coming to Britain have risen. Cardinal Nichols added: 'What I want to keep saying is these are people we're talking about – the people who drown in the Mediterranean trying to get into Europe, the people who are caged in Calais because they're desperate. 'We have to somehow keep the human person at the front of all of these issues and remember that this city, for example, would grind to a halt without the contribution of people who've come to this country. Labour's Yvette Cooper warned immigration into Britain is too high but claimed setting a target is the wrong approach . 'The vast majority of immigrants come here and work hard and make a very positive contribution. That's the tone in which we should be having this debate.' A record 624,000 arrived in Britain in a year, up from 530,000 in the previous 12 months. At the same time, 327,000 left, a figure which has barely changed since 2010. A total of 37,000 Romanian and Bulgarian arrived in the UK, up from 24,000 in the previous 12 months. Of these, 27,000 were coming for work, a rise of 10,000 on year, after work restrictions were lifted in January 2014. Despite the humiliation of his broken promise, the Prime Minister has vowed to stick to his target of cutting net migration below 100,000. Mr Cameron said last month: 'Back in the 1980s when we had an open economy, we had migration in the tens of thousands, and do you know what immigration ceased to be for many years a political issue on our country.' He added: 'I believe that we would be a better, stronger country if we had net migration in the tens of thousands rather than the hundreds of thousands.' Today Labour's Yvette Cooper warned immigration into Britain is too high but claimed setting a target is the wrong approach. The shadow home secretary said her party would focus on illegal immigration and short term student visas in an effort to bring net migration down. Asked whether immigration was too high, Ms Cooper told BBC One's Andrew Marr Show: 'Yes and we have said that before and we would like to see it come down.' Pressed on whether Labour would set a target for net migration, she said: 'He (Mr Cameron) failed in that approach. 'I think that is the wrong approach to take because what he's done is he set a target for net migration, he said no ifs no buts he was going to meet it, and in fact the actual level is three times the target that he set. 'And also a net migration target puts all immigration in together, so it treats students, alongside people coming to work alongside people who are looking for work alongside people who might have come for family reasons, alongside refugees. 'It puts all of those different kinds of immigration together. I think that is the wrong approach.'","Letter to 500,000 parishes warns of blaming immigrants for ills of society .

Lisa Blake, 41, spent six years and £7,000 trying to conceive as her and her partner Stephen, 37, both suffer from unexplained fertility problems. After a fourth round of IVF failed, the couple, from Gateshead, Tyne and Wear, were told their chances of having a baby was less than five per cent unless they found an egg donor. Seeing how desperate they were to become parents, Miss Blake's younger sister, Julie Wealand, 35, offered to donate her own eggs. And finally, in December 2013, Miss Blake became pregnant. She gave birth to healthy twin baby boys Joshua and Harrison, now 8 months, in July last year. Lisa Blake, 41, gave birth to healthy twin boys Joshua and Harrison, now 8 month, in July 2014 . Miss Blake said: 'I was so happy to discover that I was finally pregnant. 'Julie has given me the best gift I could ask for, I'll be forever grateful.' The couple's fertility problems began in 2007 after they started trying for a baby. Miss Blake, who has been in a relationship with Stephen for 15 years, said: 'We started trying for baby when I was 34, but after two years we realised something was wrong. 'Doctors couldn't explain my fertility problems - I just couldn't get pregnant. My sister had also struggled to conceive so I knew my age wasn't to blame. 'Growing up, I always dreamed of having at least two children, and there was nothing I wanted more than to be a mum. 'My friends have kids, most from when they were younger, so I only had to attend one baby shower. But when I saw people with children, I wished it would be me.' Aged 36, she turned to IVF treatment in an attempt to conceive. But three agonising years and three failed IVF attempts later, the pair were still childless. Meanwhile her sister Mrs Wealand, who lives in California with her husband, gave birth to two children of her own, conceived through IVF treatment. Miss Blake said: 'I was truly pleased for her when she said she was pregnant. Even though she lives abroad, we're really close and I loved buying clothes for my unborn nephew. 'But I still longed for a child so Stephen and I pooled our life savings to buy a fourth round of IVF. 'Adopting would have been our final chance for children because we couldn't afford to pay for more treatments.' Miss Blake (right) had been trying to conceive for six years, and had spent £7,000 on IVF treatment. She was only able to have children when her sister, Julie Wealand, 35, (left), donated her eggs . Miss Blake became pregnant in December 2013, and gave birth to twins Joshua and Harrison in July 2014. She said her sister had given her 'the best gift she could have ever asked for' But the consultant broke the news that they had just a five per cent chance of conceiving and the chances would only increase if they were to use donated eggs. Miss Blake said: 'At first we were devastated - they didn't accept anonymous donors so we had to find someone that we knew, who would be willing to donate their eggs. 'We went to my parent's house where my sister was staying and told her what the consultant said. 'She promptly replied ""You can use mine"". 'I was in disbelief and giddy with excitement.' After Mrs Wealand's generous offer, they began the long process of tests and counselling. Her eggs were harvested and fertilised with Stephen's sperm. A year later, Miss Blake was implanted with Mrs Wealand's eggs, but sadly, it was unsuccessful. Miss Blake said: 'I was so disappointed when I discovered that Julie's eggs hadn't worked. 'But despite the emotional toll, I knew I had to just carry on.' So later that year in December 2013, they tried for the final time, using Miss Wealand's embryos they'd frozen from the fourth try. Miss Blake, pictured with partner Stephen, 37, and her newborn babies, gave birth by Caesarean section as doctors feared she might be suffering from pre-eclampsia . Miss Blake and her partner said they were 'overjoyed' when they discovered they were having twins, who, eight months later, are thriving . She will now celebrate Mother's day with her sons. She said: 'I'll be forever grateful to my sister for giving me the best present ever: motherhood' Miss Blake became pregnant two weeks later and discovered she was having twins. She said: 'I'd taken at least 50 pregnancy tests, which were all negative, while trying to conceive from IVF, so seeing the little blue line on the pregnancy test was surreal. 'During a hospital scan, we discovered we were having twins, I was even more overjoyed.' At 35 weeks, doctors worried that Lisa was suffering from pre-eclampsia - a dangerous condition involving high blood pressure, which affects some women in the second half of their pregnancy. In order to minimize the risk, doctors delivered the twin babies via Caesarean section. Miss Blake said: 'I was disappointed that I wouldn't have a natural birth, but all I cared about was the boys being healthy. 'Julie wanted to be my side when I gave birth, but only one person is allowed in the operating theatre so Stephen clutched my hand instead. 'Without her, we wouldn't have a beautiful family.' Now eight months old, Harrison and Joshua are thriving. Miss Blake said: 'I still can't believe I'm a mum and I can't wait to celebrate Mother's Day with the boys. 'I'll be forever grateful to my sister for giving me the best present ever: motherhood.'","Lisa Blake, 41, and her partner Stephen were desperate to have children .

4b9087acd56acdda56f211339ad0aac8f04b2214,"Jodi Arias was sentenced to life behind bars today after a jury failed to reach a verdict on whether to execute her for the murder of her ex-boyfriend Travis Alexander - causing his distraught sister to break down in tears and wish Arias to 'burn in hell'. The harrowing scene played out in Maricopa Country Superior Court as Judge Sherry Stephens declared a mistrial meaning Arias, 34, would not be able to face the death penalty. Tanisha Sorenson was overcome with grief and held her face in her hand as other members of Alexander's family wept while a shackled Arias looked on impassively as she escaped with her life. Speaking to the media afterwards, a furious Sorensen said, 'The real justice will be in the afterlife when Jodi burns in hell.' It is now up to the judge to decide if Arias gets 25-years to-life with parole or without parole and Stephens told the court she would announce this in April. Scroll Down for Video . Impassive: Jodi Arias watches the jury enter the courtroom for her sentencing phase retrial in Phoenix on Thursday morning . Reaction: Tanisha Sorenson, sister of Travis Alexander, sobs as she hears a hung jury verdict in the Jodi Arias sentencing phase retrial . Agony: Tanisha Sorenson becomes inconsolable after hearing that Jodi Arias has escaped the death penalty . Arias' mother, Sandra, broke down too and received a hug from a friend. It is the second time a jury has failed to decide on life or death for Arias, 34, and under Arizona state law she cannot be tried again - a sore disappointment for the prosecution who have always sought execution. Indeed, it was revealed afterwards that jurors who deadlocked on punishment for convicted murderer Jodi Arias say they were split 11-1 in favor of the death penalty and that they tried unsuccessfully to get the lone dissenter, a woman, kicked off the panel. Fourteen jurors, including at least one alternate and one woman removed from the panel earlier, talked to reporters Thursday after the verdict. None of them would reveal their names. Many of the jurors said Arias lacked remorse and some said she tried to manipulate them. Jurors also said they believed the holdout was biased and that the woman even had an agenda. 'The one holdout had her mind made up from the beginning,' a male juror said according to AZ Central. 'The 11 of us strived for justice, but to no avail,' another juror, who was also not identified, said. 'We absolutely feel the penalty should have been death.' Realization: Sorenson raises her hand to her face as she breaks down in tears after Jodi Arias verdict was announced . The Alexander family released a statement to say they are 'saddened by the jury's inability to reach a decision on the death penalty. However, they understand the difficulty of the decision, and have nothing but respect for the jury's time.' 'Obviously, as I said, during the closing arguments, during the opening statements, and several times during the trial, that the events of June 4, 2008 were a tragedy, and the no verdict ultimately could repair that sadness. I don't think today's victory will repair any sadness or change anything but we hope it can begin the closure process for all those who were affected by that tragedy. Thank you,' Arias' defense attorney Kirk Nurmi told reporters Thursday. 'Travis Alexander's surviving brothers and sisters Gary Alexander, Dennis ""Greg"" Alexander, Tanisha Sorenson, Samantha Alexander, Hillary Wilcox, Steven Alexander and Allie Iglesias are saddened by the jury's inability to reach a decision on the death penalty. 'However, they understand the difficulty of the decision, and have nothing but respect for the jury's time. They appreciate Deputy Count Attorney's Juan Martinez and appreciate the outpouring of support they have received from the public. 'Without the public's support, it would have been impossible for the family to attend trial over the past many years while the case worked its way through the justice system. 'The siblings request that their privacy be respected. They will not be making any further statements or participate in any interviews at this time.' The controversial decision came after jurors deliberated for five days over the 2008 murder which Arias was found guilty of in 2013. Arias, a 34-year-old former waitress from Salinas, California, was found guilty of the murder in 2013, but jurors at the original trial deadlocked on whether to give her the death penalty. Prosecutors accuse Arias of murdering her ex-partner, Travis Alexander, in a jealous rage, but she says she acted in self-defense. Alexander, 30, was found dead in a shower at his Phoenix-area home. He had been stabbed multiple times, his throat was cut almost from ear to ear, and he had been shot in the face. In closing statements, defense attorney Kirk Nurmi called for Arias' life to be spared, describing her as a remorseful and mentally ill woman who had been abused since childhood. Prosecutor Juan Martinez accused Arias of acting in a cold and calculating way and said there were no factors preventing the jury from giving her the death penalty. On Tuesday, the jury of eight women and four men were told by Maricopa County Superior Court Judge Sherry Stephens to try harder to come to a decision, after apparently deadlocking. Arias decided not to plead her case directly to the jury at the end of the sentencing retrial after Stephens denied the defendant's request that the courtroom be closed to the public and media during her comments. The original trial in 2013 was broadcast live and drew a large audience with its gruesome crime scene photographs and sexually explicit testimony. Grief stricken:Sorenson cries as she leaves the court house with family and friends on Thursday in Phoenix . Tears for her brother: Family members of victim Travis Alexander wept when the judge said jurors couldn't reach a decision. They sobbed as they left the courtroom . New home: This is the exact bed that Jodi Arias will now be transferred to at Lumley Unit of the Arizona State Prison Complex - Perryville near Goodyear . Lumley Unit of the Arizona State Prison Complex - Perryville near Goodyear: This will be Jodi Arias' new home . Defense attorney Kirk Nurmi pleaded for Arias' (pictured with defense attorney Jennifer Willmott) life during his closing arguments last Tuesday, saying she was physically and emotionally abused by Alexander . On Tuesday, Maricopa County Superior Court Judge Sherry Stephens denied a request by Arias' attorneys for a mistrial and instead read additional jury instructions to the jury in her sentencing retrial. Defense attorney Kirk Nurmi said in court that jurors were at an impasse, though the judge and prosecutor Juan Martinez never confirmed that in open court. Jurors posed two questions to Stephens, who didn't reveal details. The judge and lawyers held closed-door discussions shortly before jurors were brought into the courtroom. Stephens told them that she didn't intend to force a verdict and said in her instructions that jurors shouldn't weigh evidence based on the views of other jurors. If the current jury can't decide on a sentence, the death penalty would be removed as an option and the judge would decide if Arias serves life in prison or gets a chance for release after 25 years. Last week, Nurmi pleaded Arias' life, saying she was physically and emotionally abused as a child and by former boyfriend Alexander. A judge declared a mistrial Thursday in the Jodi Arias sentencing case after a jury deadlocked on whether the convicted murderer should be executed or sent to prison for life for killing her lover in 2008. Tragedy: Arias' 2013 trial became a sensation with its tawdry revelations about her relationship with Alexander and that she shot him in the head and slit his throat so deeply that he was nearly decapitated . Arias stabbed Alexander 30 times, nearly decapitated him when she slit his throat and shot him in the forehead . Alexander's body was found in the shower of his Phoenix home by his friends five days later . Nurmi said Alexander was a conflicted Mormon, who used Arias to satisfy his sexual desires and called her 'soulless'. 'Those words have impact and they got to her,' Nurmi said. Arias cried as prosecutor Juan Martinez displayed gruesome autopsy photographs of Alexander on a large screen during his closing argument. Martinez described Arias as a liar who was trying to trick the jury into believing she was the victim. He then pointed to the photograph of Alexander's decomposed body, covered in stab wounds, his throat cut and a gunshot wound to the forehead. 'That's what she wants you to believe,' he said. 'But actually, in reality, it's this.' Alexander's family and friends sobbed in the courtroom as the gruesome photographs were displayed. So concluded the five-month sentencing phase that was much quieter than the 2013 murder trial that made Arias a cable television and tabloid sensation.","Judge Sherry Stephens was told of impasse on Thursday morning .

The pair became embroiled in a heated argument at half-time during the champions’ 2-1 defeat at Liverpool earlier this month. Both were omitted from the starting XI for the following match against Leicester. But City say the row had nothing to do with Manuel Pellegrini’s selection and the warring duo could be back in the line-up for Saturday’s match at Turf Moor.

Kompany was dropped to the bench when Manchester City hosted Leicester City last week . Kompany attempts to tackle Raheem Sterling during City's 2-1 defeat by Liverpool three days earlier . Tempers flared at Anfield when City returned to the dressing room with the score 1-1. In the build-up to Liverpool’s opener, midfielder Fernandinho sold defender Kompany  short with a poor pass before Jordan Henderson scored. ‘Fernandinho had a go at Vinnie and he went right back at him,’ a City insider told Sportsmail. ‘He was raging. Others had to get involved to stop it.’ According to reports, Pellegrini sided with the Brazilian, which prompted more fury from Kompany before team-mates stepped in. City declined to comment on the incident, but strongly deny it influenced Pellegrini’s decision to rest Fernandinho and bench Kompany for the 2-0 win over Leicester. Fernandinho started the game against Liverpool but was dropped out of the squad for the next game . City captain Kompany trains before his side's Premier League clash with Leicester . Kompany, who signed a new five-year contract last summer following a 2008 move from Hamburg, was an unused substitute for the following match, a 2-0 win over bottom-of-the-table Leicester City, with Pellegrini claiming he needed to freshen his side up. Brazilian Fernandinho, a £34m signing from Shakhtar Donetsk in 2013, was left out of the squad altogether. Manchester City declined to comment on the incident. However, they are understood to be happy that there is no lingering animosity, believe the row was over as quickly as it started and are of the opinion that it was similar to disagreements that happen on a regular basis in dressing rooms across the country. They are also keen to point out that it had nothing to do with Kompany not playing the next game.

John Derick Sandham, 31, was at his reception at a pub in Holywell, Flintshire, when he launched an attack on a group of young friends also having a drink at the venue. The court heard how Sandham, who had swapped vows with his wife Clare just hours earlier, head-butted one victim before hitting him in the face with a glass or a bottle. John Derick Sandham, 31 (pictured left with wife Clare and right) has been jailed for three years after sparking a brawl at his wedding reception at a pub in Holywell, Flintshire, in August 2013 . Sandham, who had swapped vows with his wife Clare just hours earlier (pictured), launched the attack on three teeangers, head-butting one victim before hitting another in the face with a glass or a bottle . He then grabbed another of the teenagers by the throat, before hitting the third victim on the back of the head, Mold Crown Court was told. It came after he told the trio that he could 'knock them out with one punch'. Sandham had claimed he was acting in self-defence, telling the court: 'This was my wedding night. It is supposed to be the happiest day of my life and it was blighted by this.' But he was found guilty of the three assaults and sentenced to the three-year jail term. Sentencing Sandham, Judge Philip Hughes said: 'It was drunken violence against youths who had done nothing to warrant your aggression against them.' The court heard how the brawl broke out in August 2013 while 100 friends and family were marking the marriage at the Abbott's Arms in Holywell, North Wales. The defendant (pictured left and right) had claimed self-defence but he was found guilty of the three assaults and sentenced to the three-year jail term . The victims, who were aged 16 and 17, were not part of the wedding party. The court heard how the incident took place when Sandham went outside at the end of the night to say 'goodbye' to his guests. The defendant walked through the porch, where he was said to have asked the friends - who were 'having a laugh and messing about' - what they were saying. He then walked straight up to the group and grabbed one of them, before launching the furious attacks, the court heard. The brawl unfolded in the porch at the Abbot's Arms in Holywell, Flintshire (pictured), the court heard .

aa8860df154872936a867c8c7504fbedc2078f07,"Children are suffering damage to their hearts as early as 12 due to poor diets, a study has warned. Researchers found most people start life with robust heart health, but can lose it quickly through unhealthy eating habits. The American study showed few children under the age of 12 had an ideal diet and almost a third (30 per cent) were overweight or even obese. The researchers said the better equipped children are to make healthy choices, the healthier their hearts will be in adulthood. Study senior author Doctor Donald Lloyd-Jones, professor and chair of preventive medicine at the Northwestern University Feinberg School of Medicine in Chicago, said: ‘Our findings indicate that, in general, children start with pretty good blood pressure. Scroll down for video . Scientists said the better equipped children are to make healthy food choices, the healthier their hearts would be in adulthood. They said few children under the age of 12 taking part had an ideal diet, and almost a third were overweight or even obese (file picture posed by model) ‘But if they have a horrible diet, it will drive a worsening body mass index (BMI) and cholesterol levels. ‘The better we can equip our children to make healthy choices, the more cardiovascular health will be preserved into adulthood. ‘And those who preserve their heart health into middle age live much longer and are much healthier while they live.’ Researchers examined BMI, healthy diet, total cholesterol and blood pressure – four of the seven components of heart health – in children aged two to 11. In the sample of 8,961 children, the researchers found that all children had at least one ideal measure, but none had all four. An ideal diet score was the least prevalent health indicator, with less than one per cent of children having four or five of the five components of a healthy diet. The experts warned people are losing a lot of 'intrinsic' heart health very early in life, setting them up to be unhealthy adults . The five indicators of a healthy diet include low intake of sugar-sweetened drinks and salt, and high intake of wholegrains, fish, plus fruit and vegetables. Fewer than 10 per cent ate the recommended amounts of fruit and veg of more than 4.5 cups or more per day or fish, and wholegrains were the least frequently achieved component with just three per cent of boys and 2.4 per cent of girls hitting the target. Ninety per cent ate more salt than recommended, and more than half consumed more than the recommended number of calories from sugar-sweetened drinks. Around four out of ten of the children had ‘poor’ or ‘intermediate’ cholesterol levels, according to the findings published in the journal Circulation: Cardiovascular Quality and Outcomes. Researchers found ideal blood pressure was the most common favourable measure of cardiovascular health, ranging from 88 per cent to 93 per cent across sex and racial groups. Previous studies have shown worsening indicators of cardiovascular health, starting in adolescence and continuing through adulthood. Dr Lloyd-Jones added: ‘We really need better surveillance data, especially in children. ‘Information on physical activity, blood glucose and smoking or exposure to second-hand smoke are not available for younger children. ‘Without knowing how much physical activity a child is doing, and therefore how many calories are needed, we can’t scale the diet metrics to a child’s needs. ‘So we used the adult metrics, but understand that it would be difficult for a five-year-old to take in as many fruits and vegetables as an adult. ‘The bottom line is that we need even better data, but what we do see is that we are losing an awful lot of our intrinsic cardiovascular health very early in life, which sets us up to be unhealthy adults.’","Most people start life with robust heart health, but can lose it quickly .

f6df60905f257355d35a74b57da1db14cc225cb3,"Former Republican presidential candidate Mitt Romney poked fun at Barack Obama's penchant for golf, Hillary Clinton's emails and even discussed One Direction on the Tonight Show. In the interview with Jimmy Fallon, Romney talked to his 'reflection' in the mirror and cracked jokes at the President's expense and at his own failed attempt to reach the White House. Earlier this year Romney declared he would not be running for the presidency again, which gave him free rein in the interview. Scroll down for video . In the interview with Jimmy Fallon on Tonight Show, Mitt Romney made jokes at President Obama's expense . In the 'Mitt in the Mirror' sketch, Romney pretended to talk to himself in the mirror with host Jimmy Fallon . Obama has played more than 200 rounds of golf as President - a point Romney joked about in the interview . Referring to his upcoming charity boxing bout against Evander Holyfield, Romney quipped: 'I guess it's not the first time we lose to a black guy' Fallon, pretending to be Romney in the mirror, opened up by asking the real Romney whether he was ready for the big interview. 'Well, actually I'm a little nervous,' Romney admitted. 'Jimmy is probably going to ask me why I didn't run for president. What should I say?' 'Just tell him you enjoy the freedom. You get to sit back, relax, golf all the time, go on vacation whenever you want,' Fallon said as Romney's reflection. 'Aka, be president?' Romney quipped. Obama - who was derided by basketball ace Michael Jordan as a 'hack' on the course - has played more than 200 rounds of golf since he entered the White House. Romney joked about Zayn leaving One Direction saying it was one of the 'important issues facing this nation' Romney made light of the numerous rounds of golf Obama has played since he entered the White House . Romney then went on to discuss his upcoming bout with former heavyweight boxing champion, Evander 'the Real Deal' Holyfield. Romney's reflection wanted some assurance they were not crazy for taking to the ring with the four-time heavyweight champion. The real Romney replied: 'It's all in good fun. It's for charity, what's the worse that can happen?' His reflection joked: 'That's true, I guess it's not the first time we lose to a black guy'. Romney will be squaring off against Holyfield - who famously had part of his ear bitten off by 'Iron' Mike Tyson in 1997 - for Charity Vision's 'Fight Night' in Salt Lake City on May 15. The pair clearly enjoyed the sketch, which mocked Hillary Clinton's emails and Obama's love of golf . Romney then delved into the world of showbiz to discuss Zayn Malik's departure from boy band One Direction. He said: 'There are important issues facing this great nation; turmoil in the Middle East, an immigration crisis here at home and now Zayn has quit One Direction. Thanks Obama.' Moving back to more familiar ground, the real Romney interrupted saying: 'I've got an email here. Hold on, let me take a look.' Fallon, as Romney's reflection, asked: 'Is it work or personal?' To this, Romney quipped: 'Well, the email is from Hillary Clinton, so I guess it's both.' This joke comes in the wake of revelations that Mrs Clinton did not have a government email address from 2009 to 2013. The correspondence of federal officials is considered government records under federal law. While there are exceptions for classified materials, most documents are kept for the use of journalists, congressional committees and historians. Following the controversy, Mrs Clinton said she had simply used private emails out of 'convenience' during her time as Secretary of State. In response to the attention, Clinton said she had in December 2014 handed over 55,000 pages of e-mails to the State Department following their request and now wanted them made public. Romney joked about Mrs Clinton's emails - she did not have a government email address from 2009 to 2013 . Referring to Zayn's split from One Direction, Romney remarked: 'There are important issues facing this great nation; turmoil in the Middle East, an immigration crisis here at home and now Zayn has quit One Direction' Romney, a former Governor of Massachusetts, was defeated by Obama in the 2012 presidential election. In January, he revealed he would not be running for the presidency again. Mr Romney, 68, said he had decided it was 'best to give other leaders in the party the opportunity to become our next nominee'. This week, Ted Cruz, the firebrand Texas senator, became the first Republican candidate to declare himself officially in the race before a crowd of thousands at Liberty University in Virginia.","Romney, who will not run for presidency, joked about Obama's love of golf .

But the pair were silenced by brave Mrs Jones's five-second warning - and fled the post office at Graig-yr-Rhacca, near Caerphilly, South Wales. Cool Mrs Jones even served another customer at the shop in Graig-yr-Rhacca, near Caerphilly, South Wales, before calling the police. Police arrested Price at his home and found a blue imitation gun along with a balaclava and a paint balling mask used in the February raid. Recorder Judge Eleri Rees praised Mrs Jones for her bravery at Cardiff Crown Court after the pair admitted their crimes. She said: 'To her credit she showed great resilience she stood her ground and then called the police. You were armed with an imitation firearm- she had no idea if it was a real firearm or not. Speaking after the sentencing at Cardiff Crown Court, pictured, Mrs Jones's son Simon, 48, said: 'She was resilient on that day but then went downhill. She has picked up now and is back working.' 'We have a 72-year-old lady who had worked at that post office for many years. Price, of Machen, near Caerphilly, was sentenced to a total of three and a half years imprisonment. Homeless Andrews was sentenced to a total of four years and eight months imprisonment. The judge lifted reporting restrictions that had previously banned the identification of Price because of his age.

But an American filmmaker has created a three-minute video that presents Paris in an entirely unique way. Sean Collins, a 31-year-old from Los Angeles, used special effects to make the French capital's famous landmarks, including the Eiffel Tour and Arc de Triomphe, and pedestrians look like miniature toys. The video is the work of photographer Sean Collins, who studied at the American School of Paris . The American video maker captures a shot of the Eiffel Tower in the distance of his unique film . Sean filmed the scenes over the course of eight days while visiting his girlfriend, a Boston University student who is studying in Paris. He said: ‘When I went to visit her we decided to make this video. On her days off she accompanied me to the sites to film. ‘We couldn't film on rainy, cloudy or days with poor air quality and we had to go to each location multiple times.’ Sean, who was educated at The American School of Paris, but later studied at a film school in California, explained that his intention was to present the French capital in a way it has never been seen before. Sean Collins experimented with effects that make Paris famous landmarks look like small toy sets . The people captured underneath the Eiffel Tower in a timelapse shot appear to look like figurines . He said: ‘My goal was to show Paris to the world in a new light for those who have never had the experience or never managed to make it those sites.’ The video opens on a landscape shot of the city, with the Eiffel Tower and Army Museum appearing to be positioned almost too close together. The Champ de Mars is presented in beautiful saturated green colours with people walking around it, appearing to look like figurines. Sean spent two weeks testing different ways to change the texture of the different images . A train is captured in the film and appears to look like a toy being controlled by a child . Shots of boats travelling under bridges tie Paris' natural beauty with its urban iconography . A couple of timelapse shots of the Eiffel Tower continue this theme before a train, which looks like it could be being controlled by a child, travels across a bridge. More landscape shots show a breakdancer looking like a puppet on a string and a group playing football. As darkness descends on the Parisian streets the landscapes become more beautiful, before daylight is reinstated and the traffic begins to swell. Sean recorded the video over eight days with the help of his girlfriend who he was visiting in Paris . The Arc de Triomphe is momentarily captured before more close-ups shots of people looking like toys . A distant shot of the Arc de Triomphe is momentarily captured before more close-ups of people negotiating busy streets. Eventually the video concludes with footage of pigeons, a boat travelling under a bridge – which ties Paris’ beauty as a natural landscape and an urban city together – and a casual shot of the Eiffel Tower. Discussing the difficulties faced while filming, Sean explained that the final result is the product of much experimentation. Sean's goal was to show Paris in a new light for those who have never had the chance to experience it . Sean had to prepare for each shot and was unable to film on rainy or cloudy days or days with poor air quality . ‘It's not as simple as just adding blur to the top and bottom to achieve the effect. I spent two weeks testing different ways to change the ""texture"" of the image,’ he said. ‘I experimented with some really distorted toy-like effects but eventually settled on this more subtle effect. This was a combination of noise reduction and sharpening.’ Sean’s work is available on his Facebook page and the original video can be viewed here.","Sean Collins, from LA, created the three-minute footage over eight days .

But as Australia and New Zealand go head-to-head in the World Cup final at the Melbourne Cricket Ground on Sunday, the underarm bowling incident from 1981 will inevitably come back to haunt. The  controversial bowl triggered a cold war between the two nations after the infamous day  on February 1 when New Zealand needed six runs with one ball remaining to draw the match. But Aussie skipper Greg Chappell instructed the bowler, who was his younger brother Trevor, to deliver the ball underarm in a bid to prevent batsman Brian McKechnie any chance of hitting a six. Scroll down for video . It was a single bowl that triggered a massive uproar at the time when Aussie bowler delivered an underarm . As the ball gently rolled down the pitch, McKechnie blocked the ball before he tossed his bat to the ground out of anger and disgust. Australia went on to win the match but the hell that followed left the Chappell brothers struggling to cope under the pressure from the backlash. Despite the underarm bowling was not ruled as illegal at the time, it was deemed 'an act of cowardice' and against the true spirit of cricket that cost New Zealand the tournament. Aussie bowler Trevor Chappell, right, bowls underarm to New Zealand batsman Brian McKechnie on the last ball of a one-day international from which New Zealand needed to hit six runs to force a tie . Trevor Chappell bowls under-arm, as ordered by brother Greg at the Melbourne Cricket Ground in 1981 . But Black Caps fast bowler Tim Southee, who was two-years-old at the time of the underarm incident, said the infamous bowl is rarely mentioned. 'I guess a few of us were too young to remember seeing it but we know it happened,' Southee said at a conference on Friday. 'I haven’t heard too much about the underarm.' While New Zealand prepares ahead of their first ever World Cup final on Sunday, Aussie skipper Michael Clarke has announced his retirement from one-day cricket on the eve of the match. The 33-year-old reached closure on the decision upon realising there was no chance he'd still be leading the side in four years.","The notorious underarm incident triggered a massive uproar in 1981 .

0b00c7c4c20e7049d731d0123945387add6e51dd,"Tax hikes in the last five years have raised an extra £16.4billion a year, equivalent of around £255 for every person in the UK. A new study by the Institute for Fiscal Studies found that by 2015-16, will have imposed tax rises worth £64.3 billion while tax cuts have totalled only £48billion. The figures come ahead of George Osborne's final Budget before the election, with Labour warning they lay bare the full extent of the government's failure to fix the economy. Chancellor George Osborne, pictured today, is expected to use his Budget on Wednesday to announce a nother increase in the personal tax allowance . Tax rises introduced since 2010 include a £14 billion hike in VAT and a £5.2 billion increase in National Insurance contributions. At the same time the tax reductions of 48 billion include £8 billion from raising the personal threshold for income tax, £5.9 billion in cuts to corporation tax and £3.9 billion from real-terms reductions in fuel duties. However, the IFS said the changes were a 'missed opportunity to improve the tax system', because they had been introduced in a piecemeal way with little attempt to address 'fundamental structural deficiencies'. Several of the changes have exacerbated 'unwelcome distortions' in the system, said the IFS. It was difficult to find a 'good economic reason' for lifting ever-more lower-paid workers out of income tax while leaving National Insurance thresholds largely untouched, and it was an 'absurdity' that the two taxes had not been integrated. Mr Osborne is expected to use Wednesday's Budget to announce another big rise in the personal tax allowance. Deputy PM Nick Clegg said: ‘The main thing the government can do is just take less of your money away from you. ‘I very much want to give the biggest possible Workers’ Bonus to millions of people on middle and low incomes.' The  study by the Institute for Fiscal Studies found that by 2015-16, will have imposed tax rises worth £64.3 billion while tax cuts have totalled only £48billion . The IFS highlighted the 'problematic' failure to uprate tax thresholds in line with inflation, and warned of a 'rapid' increase in workers paying higher rates of income tax as the economy improves. Unless the phenomenon known as 'fiscal drag' is dealt with, the number of families losing some or all of their child benefit will double within a decade, the report predicted. The report also warned that council tax had been allowed to get 'ever more out of date', with bands in England and Scotland based on property prices in 1991. And it said that areas such as fuel duties and business rates had 'seen a stream of ad hoc, often temporary, announcements overtaking each other without a clear statement of principles or long-run intentions'. Labour's shadow chancellor Ed Balls said the Tory idea that cutting taxes for a few at the top means wealth will trickle down to everyone else hasn’t worked . Authors Stuart Adam and Barra Roantree said: 'There is a better way to make tax policy. The corporate tax road map was a good start, setting out a direction of travel and providing an element of predictability. The next government would be well advised to apply this approach to more elements of the tax system, and indeed to the tax system as a whole. 'That would help taxpayers to plan, provide a benchmark for assessing the policies actually implemented, and facilitate debate on whether the strategy laid out is the right one. Taking the time to articulate a strategy might even lead to the adoption of better tax policy.' Labour's shadow chancellor Ed Balls told the Standard: 'The old Tory idea that cutting taxes for a few at the top means wealth will trickle down to everyone else hasn’t worked. And once again, a Tory Chancellor is giving with one hand but taking away much more with the other. 'No pre-election tax cut can mask the £1,127 a year which the Institute for Fiscal Studies (IFS) says families have lost because of tax and benefit changes since 2010 — from higher VAT to cuts to tax credits.'","By 2015-16 coalition will have imposed tax rises worth £64.3 billion .

de6c89a6df60591148429a916d50983de1f42714,"(CNN)Chelsea's good week continued when the Blues beat West Ham 1-0 in the English Premier League to maintain a five-point lead over Manchester City atop the table. Chelsea manager Jose Mourinho -- who picked up another trophy Sunday in the League Cup final -- had never lost to West Ham in the top flight and Belgian attacker Eden Hazard ensured three more points when he netted in the first half Wednesday at the Hammers' Upton Park. ""The game was very difficult,"" Hazard told Sky. ""One big battle against a good team with very good players. ""It's always difficult when you don't score the second goal to kill the game. But one goal was enough. It's not always like this. ""The goalkeeper, the defense we have are very strong. It was very good."" Chelsea keeper Thibaut Courtois made a string of good saves in the second half but West Ham boss Sam Allardyce lamented his team's finishing -- plus the refereeing. He felt Hazard's goal was offside. ""When you look back on the season and they say these things even themselves out, that's the biggest load of rubbish I've ever heard,"" the under pressure Allardyce told Sky. Nigel Pearson, manager of last-place Leicester, also felt aggrieved after his team lost 2-0 to reigning league champion Manchester City. Leicester didn't get a penalty when City striker Wilfried Bony appeared to foul Jeff Schlupp in the  box in the first half or when Fernando fouled Andrej Kramaric in the second. Leicester struck the woodwork, too. City -- reeling following back-to-back defeats to Barcelona in the Champions League and Liverpool -- only really came to life after David Silva's opener in first-half stoppage time. Leicester's veteran keeper Mark Schwarzer thwarted City to keep it close but could do little on James Milner's 88th-minute effort. The win was ""very important because it was a very difficult week with two bad results against Liverpool and Barcelona,"" said City manager Manuel Pellegrini, who rested club captain Vincent Kompany. Elsewhere, four teams vying for Champions League spots all won. Manchester United claimed all three points at Newcastle when Ashley Young took advantage of keeper Tim Krul's error in the 89th minute; Arsenal doubled third-last QPR 2-1; surging Liverpool shut out second-last Burnley 2-0; and League Cup finalist Tottenham defeated Swansea 3-2 in a game overshadowed by French striker Bafetimbi Gomis collapsing to the turf. United defender Jonny Evans might have been fortunate to escape unpunished at St. James' Park, since he appeared to spit in striker Papiss Cisse's direction when they clashed in the first half. Cisse then appeared to spit back at Evans. Arsenal remained third, with United in fourth on 53 points, two better than Liverpool, four better than Southampton and six better than Spurs, who have a game in hand. In Wednesday's other match, Stoke extended Everton's league slide by blanking the Toffees 2-0 at home. Barcelona reaches Copa del Rey final . In Spain, meanwhile, Barcelona reached the Copa del Rey final by easing past Villarreal 6-2 on aggregate. Holding a 3-1 lead after the first leg, Barcelona won away by the same score Wednesday, helped by Neymar's double. Barcelona faces familiar foe Athletic Bilbao in May's finale.

f5cda2fb1455a37af718d9f85f038d5dd136697a,"(CNN)As a well-traveled photographer, Pieter ten Hoopen is no stranger to refugee camps. But he never experienced any like the Mayo camp, which is outside the Sudanese capital of Khartoum. Ten Hoopen was at the camp to photograph a new medical clinic for Emergency, a humanitarian group from Italy. He also hoped to document what life was like for refugees there. His hopes were dashed, however, when he was told he couldn't photograph outside the hospital compound. ""I had very, very hard restrictions from the Sudanese government. ... They are very well-skilled in keeping the media at bay,"" ten Hoopen said. With no freedom of movement, much like the refugees themselves, ten Hoopen resorted to an old trick he had used before while traveling in Africa. With the help of refugee hospital workers, he built a makeshift photo studio using hospital bed sheets and other materials available. The studio quickly became a sensation. Once hospital employees volunteered to have their photo taken, lines of refugees began snaking around the hospital grounds waiting to have their portraits taken. One by one, these people sat solemnly to be photographed. It was their time to be acknowledged. There was gravity, earnestness to the way they posed. This was the moment their story would be registered. ""This was one of the reasons why I built the studio: to get more material and more narratives from the people,"" ten Hoopen said. The project quickly became a catalog of the history and identity of the refugees. The photos span several generations -- some of the subjects were born at the refugee camp, some have been there for decades. Women wearing the traditional Sudanese tobe spell out their class and origin by the way it is wrapped. From the Muslim north, women are fully covered -- a contrast to women from the Christian south, who we also see represented in these photos. Whether from Sudan, South Sudan or Eritrea, the faces become, individually and collectively, a portrait of the endless wars that have shaped the Horn of Africa. Social media . Follow @CNNPhotos on Twitter to join the conversation about photography. The word refugee often conjures up images of faceless crowds fleeing conflict, their existence only registered in terms of statistics and graphs. Ten Hoopen wanted to give his subjects the ability to express themselves freely. ""They got very serious, they sat down upright. ... I tried to say as little as possible,"" he said. ""I do believe in their own expressions, their own narrative ... and their unique perspective."" The studio had a comforting effect. It was a haven from the hustling and bustling of the camp hospital. It gave the photographer an opportunity to meet his subject matter eye to eye, giving each person their deserved attention. Aesthetically, it created an aura around each person, beaming light on his or her personal narrative. It had some uplifting effects as well. ""I always try to put some extra thought to (projects). So I build classic photo studios like they have in any small towns in the African continent or in Europe ... just to give people a little bit of the feeling they are special for a short time and that someone really photographs them in an official way,"" ten Hoopen said. He said some patients at the hospital ""had being laying there for months in their room. ... Then you take them out, it's a little treat to get them out of their own misery. ... That's why you see the line growing, because they see people laughing when they come out of the studio."" Ten-month-old Buseiwa was not laughing when she entered the studio. Having just had a blood test for malaria, she clearly looked uneasy. Gazing to someone who is holding her hand, her eyes connect with this parental figure as a source of strength. Hawa Haranan, 40, came from the war-torn Darfur region before getting a job as a cleaner at the hospital. As she wears a simple tobe, one can almost see the emotions behind her leonine stare. Her life and struggle, as with the other individuals photographed, is accounted for with the testimony of a camera. Ten Hoopen used tilt-shift lenses, which are normally used with the large-format cameras used in classic photography. ""I really can appreciate old portraiture ... when people got their portrait taken in a way that was loaded, I think, with respect and it was a very serious moment,"" he said. ""It's a slow way of working where you have to put all your focus into one person sitting in front of you."" How did ten Hoopen gain the trust of so many uneasy refugees, some severely traumatized and living in fear? ""It wasn't hard,"" he said. ""I just told them to relax and have fun. ""Kids sometimes got nervous, and I don't blame them. I am a tall, white, bald European guy. ... I am not only funny to look at, but it is hot in that country so I am usually very red when I am photographing. ... I have tattoos everywhere. ... They thought I was a quite interesting creature.""

In a statement on the church website, Bishop David Kendall said the Reverend Phyllis Sortor was released Friday evening, Nigeria time, 'into the care of authorities and Free Methodist Church leaders'. Armed men abducted her on February 23 from the Hope Academy compound in Emiworo, Kogi state. Scroll down for video . Phyllis Sortor, 71, was abducted on February 23 from a Christian school in Nigeria. She was released on Friday and is safe . Masked gunman raided a Christian school and fired sporadically to scare people away before taking Sortor hostage . 'We are deeply grateful to all who prayed for Phyllis' safe return and praise God the family representative was able to secure her release,' Kendall said in his statement. He provided no details about how the release was arranged. 'As a matter of sound policy, and to help protect the many, many people who helped secure Phyllis' freedom, we will have no comment concerning the efforts that were undertaken to secure her release,' the bishop said. Kogi State police said shortly after the abduction that the men who took Sortor had demanded a ransom of nearly $300,000. Police said they were collaborating with security forces to secure her return. Friends described Sortor as courageous, tenacious and passionate about helping the people of Nigeria and said she was aware of the dangers. Sortor has been working as a missionary  for ten years. Her friends say she was passionate about helping people in Nigeria and aware of the dangers of working there . She had spent years living in Africa, including Mozambique - where she spent much of her childhood - later working in Rwanda and, since 2005, Nigeria, Kendall said . Her work in Kogi was focused primarily on educational development and conflict resolution between nomadic herdsmen and farming communities who frequently clash in central Nigeria's Middle Belt region, the church statement further said. Foreign nationals have often been kidnapped in Nigeria by local gangs who typically release hostages following a ransom payment. Such abductions are especially common in the southern, oil-producing Niger Delta, where expatriates working with large oil companies have been a frequent target. A number of foreigners have also been kidnapped in the north of the country, but those attacks claimed by Boko Haram or the associated Islamist group Ansaru are considered a different phenomenon, and not necessarily motivated by a desire for ransom. Boko Haram has been blamed for previous attacks in Kogi, including two raids targeting the same prison in 2012 and 2014. Nigeria's Islamists groups have in the past publicly claimed the abduction of expatriates and the lack of such a claim following Sortor's kidnapping led many to believe that Boko Haram and its affiliates were not involved.","Masked gunman raided a Christian school and fired sporadically to scare people away before taking Phyllis Sortor hostage on February 23 .

Posing on a £17,000 Harley-Davidson, Nick Sayer soaks up the winter sun outside his holiday home in Florida. It is one of several shots of motorbikes, supercars and lavish holidays he has posted online in recent years…to the delight of his friends. For while pensioners are targeted every day by cold callers, the man who sold their personal data is apparently relishing the spoils. B2C director Sayer – who is nicknamed Del Boy – is among a group of bosses at the firm who have got rich quick by selling people’s most personal information. The 45-year-old father-of-two says he carries out his business from a ‘man cave’ in the garden of his home in Kent. He began his working life as a diver on oil rigs in Azerbaijan, before, he claims, he was set up in business by a Greek shipping billionaire. They ran a commercial diving company before he decided to make money for himself by selling personal data with a series of companies, most of which have been dissolved or liquidated. ‘For years I was called “oh, you’re just a Del Boy”,’ he said. ‘I work from home, I’ve got a little log cabin thing out in me garden, that’s where I kind of base me-self. ‘I don’t like being in the house, I just go out there. It’s a bit of a man cave really.’ While his garden office may be modest, Sayer’s other tastes are much more ostentatious. His Facebook page shows off images of nine sports cars as well as pictures of him skiing in Banff, Canada. Scroll down for video . The British-built TVR Tuscan Speed Six sports car which he pictures on a drive on his profile costs up to £50,000 and boasts a top speed of 180mph. The Harley-Davidson Road King motorbike he is seen on in one image costs £17,595 new. Sayer regularly holidays with his family at his villa in Kissimmee, Florida, which they rent out for £600 a week. The home has a games room, swimming pool and spa, five bedrooms and four bathrooms, all ‘fitted with luxury furnishings’.

Luxury: Sayer's Flordia home has a games room, swimming pool and spa, five bedrooms and four bathrooms . The fake cash fraudster . Also trading in people’s personal information for B2C is convicted fraudster Gary Doran, 36, who wanted the Mail’s undercover team to pay Sayer off the books. The Mancunian, who now lives in Marbella, was jailed for six months for fraud in 2004 for trying to use two fake £10 notes to buy vodka. A 23-year-old student at Manchester Metropolitan University at the time, he tried to buy drink with the fake money at the Queen of Hearts pub in Fallowfield. The barmaid rejected the notes and the police were called, later finding him with 15 other fake bank notes. After serving time in jail, he has since run several failing businesses with his father and brother from their family home in Manchester. Most recently, as sales director of B2C Data, he asked an undercover reporter from the Mail to buy data off the books as a ‘favour to a friend’. He wanted the money to be paid directly into Sayer’s personal account, as a way of avoiding tax. Sporting life: The 180mph British-built TVR Tuscan Speed Six sports car on the Sayer's Facebook page . Jet-setting boss who said he knew nothing . B2C owner Stephen Hogg insists his firm ‘do everything completely, totally and utterly by the book’. The jet-setting golfer was, however, completely oblivious to his staff offering to sell data tax free through their own accounts. He even had no idea Doran had previously served time for fraud. The 46-year-old lives with his wife Sarah, 43, and their children in a £400,000 five-bedroom house in Rushden, Northamptonshire. Last week, there were three cars on the driveway outside the large home in a secluded cul-de-sac. Hogg appears to have spent much of the past month playing golf at clubs across Bedfordshire and Buckinghamshire. He and his wife also go online to boast of their holidays to Portugal and Australia. ‘Holidays, bar, golf and no diet!, he wrote during one of his travels. The couple, who have two children, started B2C Data just three months after his previous data company Unique Prospects was dissolved. He said he has also shut another firm down in the past after ‘certain allegations’, before insisting ‘that wasn’t my company by the way’. When approached by the Mail about B2C’s activities, Hogg said: ‘We are a member of the ICO [Information Commissioner’s Office], and DMA [Direct Marketing Association]. We do everything correctly.’ When told his employees had offered to sell his company’s data off the books and that Doran is a convicted fraudster, he added: ‘You’ve just made me aware of two things that I need to go and talk to people about.’ He described B2C Data as ‘a legitimate business’ working within the law. Cold callers use a wide range of tricks to obtain people's personal data (picture posed by model) Will writing: Pensioners are often targeted by callers who offer will writing advice on the cheap. This is often a ploy to gain your trust and access as many personal details – including about your finances – as possible. The firms then try to sell high risk investments as ‘add-ons’. Charity surveys: A homeowner is called and asked to complete a survey for charity. They are told if they answer a certain number of questions, a pre-selected charity will be paid £10 or so – so many kind-hearted people naturally agree. However, all the answers are collated and sold on. ‘Validating’ your details: Marketing firms will call customers of a major brand and claim they need to ‘validate’ the details they hold. After asking the customer to confirm their name, address and phone number, however, many will go on to try to get you to complete a ‘lifestyle survey’. These questions are, in fact, sponsored by various other companies and details are sold on. Soft questions: Watch out for surveys starting with ‘easy’ questions. One firm admitted it starts surveys with questions anyone would answer – like do you have a television? Only later do the questions become more intrusive – about your earnings and the worth of your home. Computer updates: Scammers try to hack into PCs by pretending to be from Microsoft. Following their ‘updating’ instructions can allow them to take control of the computer remotely and capture personal data. No call lists: The telephone preference list, which should block cold callers, is a free service. Some firms will, however, try to charge you as much as £1.60 a month. Shares: With your financial details on file, some cold calling firms are able to see which companies you have shares in. As a result, scammers can pretend to be calling from the companies you have invested in and try to convince the homeowner to pass on more financial details. Prizes: Once they have your details, scammers are able to send you misleading letters saying you have won large cash prizes. There are often hidden costs in claiming this supposed prize, like making you call premium rate phone numbers.","Nick Sayer got rich quick selling people's most personal information .

Pietersen, who is being loaned to TMS for radio stints by his World Cup employers Fox Sports, will work alongside Swann for the first time at the Auckland semi-final a week on Tuesday. And the powderkeg confrontation between the ex-England team-mates, whose relationship disintegrated in the fall-out from the 2013-14 Ashes whitewash, has been given spice with the possibility KP might now return to county cricket and the national team. Graeme Swann and Kevin Pietersen, once happy team-mates, are not longer on such good terms . Swann and Pietersen are to help commentate on Test Mach Special for the World Cup semi-finals next week . Swann has accused KP of ‘upsetting people wherever he goes’, says the ECB were ‘justified’ in terminating his England contract and calls Pietersen’s autobiography a ‘work of fiction’.

Fidel Castro’s Communist Cuba is an unlikely ally of the MCC in their battle to repel property developers Rifkind Levy Partnership.

The MCC have further kept RLP at bay by buying another well-placed house on the same street.

004ac9f58a280ff31f384ada19fe7434fd5628f7,"Boasting nothing more than an empty, concrete shell on the top level, the 'Aurora' Soul penthouse has sold for $7 million to property tycoon, Tony Fung. The aim of stripping the property for the sale was to attract a buyer who can stamp their personality on it. The gamble worked. Mr Fung had to beat six other bidders to buy the massive four-floor apartment on the Gold Coast. The apartment with its own opulent pool, luxury fittings and a massive stainless steel barbeque, became Australia's most expensive penthouse, in 2006 when an agreement was reached to sell it for nearly $17 million. But the deal with Brisbane businessman Charlie Caltabiano fell through and receivers were brought in following a legal dispute. Since then, the penthouse has been stripped of every piece of furniture, every fitting, the walls, the ceiling and even the kitchen sink. Scroll down for video . Gutted. The living area is unrecognisable from its once grand appearance, all fittings and furnishings have been removed, even exposing the air conditioning unit - the incredible 360 view of the Gold Coast, though, is still the same . The previous fit-out is long gone as the Soul Penthouse prepares to go under the hammer . The Soul Penthouse is one of the stand-out buildings along the Gold Coast skyline . The 63-year-old Hong Kong businessman is no foreigner to expanses in need of some love. He is planning to develop an $8.15 billion 'Aquis' casino and resort in Yorkey's Knob, Cairns, causing much controversy among locals. McGrath agent James Ledgerwood told The Courier Mail that this high profile buyer will attract a lot of attention to the Soul building. 'Given the new owner and his expectations, it's safe to say it will become one of the icons of penthouses in Australia.' Ledgerwood also added that spaces like this one are unique due to their versatility. 'There's not much left from how we found it,' James Ledgerwood admitted. The interior as shown in a catalogue is in stark contrast to what is there today awaiting Mr Fung's personal touch . Today: The bare bones living area. 'It's unique, a once-in-a-lifetime opportunity for buyers - we stripped it right back to a shell, that includes the limestone floors and the kitchen too' Mr Ledgerwood of selling agents McGrath told Daily Mail Australia . 'It's similar to buying a vacant house lot, but 220 metres up in the sky and with the highest swimming pool in Queensland,' he said. A spokesperson for Mr. Fung said that he was ecstatic with the recent purchase. 'It is a vote of confidence in the Queensland economy and an important addition to his property holdings in the state,' he said. Fung already owns 447 hectares worth of properties in the Gold Coast hinterland as well as an Innisfail farm, a private golf course in Noosa and he purchased Casino Canberra in December. Agent James Legerwood had previously told Daily Mail Australia that this property was a rare gem, particularly on the Gold Coast in Australia. He and co-partner John Natoli were brought in, with a clear brief, take whatever measures are needed to sell it. All cupboards and fixtures have been removed from the 'old Aurora'. It's been gutted after the $17 million sale fell through . McGrath Broadbeach selling agent James Ledgerwood. He says the new appeal of this four-level 1040 square metre property 'is that it is very, very rare that anyone gets a chance to put a penthouse together the way they want, particularly here on the Gold Coast' As it once was. The luxurious pool-side look (above) has gone to make way for a new look from new owners. The current version (below) shows Queensland's highest positioned pool and spa, but little else . As it is now. The luxurious pool-side look has gone to make way for a new look from new owners. The current version shows Queensland's highest positioned pool and spa, but little else . They took one look at the apartment which set a record when sold at $16.85m in 2006 and decided to get rid of the old fit-out . 'Look, we had to admit that it (the fit-out) that was there was not very appealing, so we decided that it needed to be ripped up.' 'It's unique, a once-in-a-lifetime opportunity for buyers - we want to sell this penthouse, so we began by stripping it right back to a shell, that includes the limestone floor and the kitchen too,' Mr Ledgerwood added. The Soul Penthouse starts on level 70 and winds its way up four levels. 'There's not much left from how we found it,' he said. At least the BBQ is still in place. One of the biggest talking points all along for the Soul Penthouse has been the swimming pool and spa area, the highest of their kind anywhere in Queensland . Eight car spaces are provided down below and even that area had been cleared out prior to the auction . However, Ledgerwood added it had some serious appeal. It's position at more than 220 metres above the ground, four levels (70-73), boasting 'the highest swimming pool and spa in Queensland', no less than eight secure basement car spaces (which have also had fittings removed) and 'full resort facilities including pools, gym and gardens'. 'This will give them (buyers) the opportunity to create their own vision and take advantage of some of the most spectacular views in Australia, and create a residence of world-class standing.' he said. 'You have spectacular views - out to the Hinterland to the west, you look east out to the ocean, then up to Stradbroke (Island) in the north and all the way down to Coolangatta down south, to be fair the previous lay-out did not do that justice.' The auction that saw Tony Fung one more Australian property richer, took place on March 7. Dream views. 'You look up to Stradbroke (Island) and all the way down to Coolangatta down south, to be fair the previous lay-out did not do that justice' said Mr Ledgerwood .

The monarch and Duke then met trustees, supporters and volunteers before meeting local school children learning about the Battle of Britain in the dedicated education area, The Geoffrey Page Centre. The Queen and The Duke also visited the 'Cockpit Café', where they met a group of 'The Few', surviving RAF airmen who fought in the Battle of Britain in the Second World War, before viewing a flypast of a Hurricane, Spitfire and Typhoon. As part of her duties, the Queen unveiled a plaque to mark the opening and received a posy. In the 1980s, Wing Commander Geoffrey Page, a Hurricane pilot who was shot down during the Battle of Britain, realised that there was no national memorial to the men he had with flown with in 1940. His efforts to amend this led to the founding of the Battle of Britain Memorial Trust and the unveiling of the National Memorial to the Few – a lone pilot looking out over the English Channel, in the village between Folkestone and Dover – by Her Late Majesty Queen Elizabeth The Queen Mother.

f37982c97d0ac9a2a4a1d76562f304a19fe433f2,"Baghdad, Iraq (CNN)Joint Iraqi forces now have control of Tikrit Military Hospital as they continue their offensive to liberate the city from ISIS. The joint forces raised the Iraqi flag from the hospital premises Wednesday as they continued their offensive into the city from four sides, the Hashd Al-Shaabi paramilitary force said. The predominantly Shia militia has been working with Iraqi troops as well as Sunni fighters to try to regain Tikrit from ISIS. The hospital is a few blocks south of the presidential palace. Tikrit, best known to Westerners as the birthplace of former Iraqi dictator Saddam Hussein, fell in June to ISIS, which has captured large areas of Iraq and Syria for what it says is its Islamic caliphate. On March 1, Iraqi Prime Minister Haider al-Abadi ordered Iraqi forces to retake Tikrit and Salahuddin province. ISIS wasn't making it easy, however. The Sunni extremist group blew up a key bridge near Tikrit, preventing the joint Iraqi forces from using it to cross the Tigris River to approach the city from the east. Nevertheless, forces have made progress, forcing ISIS fighters to retreat toward the city center from frontline positions, Hashd Al-Shaabi's media office said. There have been several failed attempts to recapture Tikrit since the second half of 2014. If Iraq regains control of the city, it could mean that retaking Mosul -- a city 10 times bigger -- is possible. The Tikrit offensive involves around 30,000 fighters. Also assisting is Iran, which has provided advisers, weapons and ammunition to the Iraqi government. According to the Pentagon, Iranians may be operating heavy artillery and rocket launchers as well. Gen. Martin Dempsey, chairman of the U.S. Joint Chiefs of Staff, told a hearing of the Senate Foreign Relations Committee on Wednesday that the consensus was that Iran's involvement was positive in military terms. ""Anything anyone does to counter ISIS is in the main a good outcome,"" he said. But at the same time, Dempsey said, the United States is concerned about what role Iran might seek in the longer term once ISIS is defeated. While Iraqi forces piled the pressure on ISIS in Tikrit, the Sunni extremist group continued to flex its muscles in Iraq's western Anbar province. ISIS launched a new offensive on the city of Ramadi, west of Baghdad, on Wednesday morning, Faleh al-Issawi, the deputy head of the Anbar Provincial Council, said in a statement. The city is being attacked ""from all directions,"" with ISIS firing more than 150 mortar rounds and rockets toward it, he said. Some 17 explosives-laden vehicles have been detonated at various security checkpoints and in the city center, he said. One vehicle targeted a bridge that provides access to the city from the north. This is ""the fiercest attack by ISIS"" seen on Ramadi, al-Issawi said. Iraqi forces have imposed a curfew on the city. Al-Issawi said the Iraqi air force was urgently needed. ""We need air cover to repel these attacks but did not see the Iraqi air force do anything -- we only saw one airstrike by the coalition hitting one target,"" he said. Officials believe ""this is an ISIS response to the Tikrit operation that is ongoing in the north,"" he added. He said there had been 10 casualties among Iraqi forces in the area but did not specify how many were killed and how many injured. In the 24 hours from Tuesday to Wednesday morning, there were 13 airstrikes in Iraq and two in Syria, the U.S.-led coalition against ISIS said in a statement. The strikes in Iraq were concentrated near Mosul, Al Qaim and Falluja. There were none in the Tikrit or Ramadi areas. Elsewhere in Anbar province, Iraqi security forces have managed to wrest back most of the town of Karma from ISIS, said Sabah Al-Karhout, the head of the Anbar Provincial Council. Al-Karhout, speaking to CNN by telephone, said 80% of Karma, about 10 miles (16 kilometers) northeast of Falluja, was now under the control of Iraqi security forces after a large-scale operation that started Tuesday at dawn. Dozens of ISIS militants were killed in clashes with Iraqi soldiers, he said. The second phase of the operation is to clear any remnants of the ISIS force from the town and to remove any mines and bombs left behind. Iraqi security forces were fighting side by side with Shia Hashd Al-Shaabi units and local tribesmen, Al-Karhout said. Health officials in Falluja told CNN that the Falluja general hospital received the bodies of 25 ISIS militants killed in the Karma battle. ISIS is also battling in many places far from Tikrit, including Syria, where the militant group is more on the offensive, according to the Syrian Observatory for Human Rights (SOHR), a London-based nongovernmental organization. ""Hundreds of ISIS militants launched a large scale offensive on Ras al Ayn, a Syrian strategic border town with Turkey on Friday,"" SOHR said in a statement Wednesday. ""They made some advances there and seized Tal Khanzir."" Clashes are still ongoing between the Kurdish People's Protection Units (Kurdish YPG) and ISIS fighters, with dozens killed from both sides, SOHR said. CNN's Kareem Khadder reported from Baghdad, and Laura Smith-Spark wrote in London.

Huge corporations are among those being given grants worth hundreds of thousands of pounds while the NHS faces a growing burden from illnesses linked to weight gain. One firm was given almost £500,000 to help improve its chocolate while others were handed large sums to make biscuits or sell ice cream. Taxpayers' money is being handed to fast-food firms such as  PepsiCo as the UK fails to tackle its ongoing obesity crisis . The revelations, contained in a study led by the UK Coronary Prevention Group, has sparked fresh claims that the Government is too close to food firms and is doing ‘too little’ to tackle the £47billion annual cost of obesity. The charity said seven in ten middle-aged adults are overweight despite the millions spent on the Government’s anti-obesity strategy and it has called for a radical overhaul of healthy-eating policies. Its report identified a string of occasions when public cash was given to firms who make millions marketing junk food for projects that undermine public health. £86,472 from public funds to help companies make confectionery wafer biscuits. £31,000 government grant to help a farmer convert a barn into an ice cream shop. £637,812 handout to help a company improve its chocolate blending equipment. £24,750 to develop 3-D chocolate printing for personalised gifts. 0%VAT charged on unhealthy cake mix, drinking chocolate and salt – compared with 20 per cent levied on mineral water and healthy snacks such as roast almonds and dried fruit. It found the Government’s Technology Strategy Board gave £637,812 to a joint project with Mondelez – the parent company of Cadbury – for ‘confectionary production’. Another grant of £487,268 was given to Nestec, part of Nestle, to research ‘chocolate cooling technology’. The board also put £356,076 into a joint project with PepsiCo to research dehydrated snacks. Meanwhile, the Rural Development Programme for England gave two grants in 2010 – £12,500 towards biscuit production and £11,400 to help convert a barn into a chocolate-making unit. The year before, the quango handed over £143,000 to convert a farm building for ice cream production. The Biotechnology and Biological Sciences Research Council put £100,173 into a project designed to improve the ‘sensory properties’ of confectionary wafers. Some £180,000 went on two other projects involving wafers. The UK Coronary Prevention Group says the Government has ‘failed’ on obesity and ‘done too little’ to tackle dietary habits. UK Coronary Prevention Group said seven in ten middle-aged adults are overweight despite the millions spent on the Government’s anti-obesity strategy and it has called for a radical overhaul of healthy-eating policies . Professor Philip James, chairman of the charity’s trustees, said: ‘Some of these grants are greater than the amounts spent by local health services tackling overweight in adults and children.’ The group has now identified 200 measures including a ban on fast-food outlets near schools and business-rate cuts for alternatives offering healthy dishes. Supermarkets would also be required to offer price promotions on healthy food, while there would be strict controls on all food sold in schools and hospitals. The report comes after it emerged last month that the Government’s anti-obesity drive was being overseen by a firm that also helps promote fast food. PR business Freud Communications earns £3million a year to run crucial public-health campaigns – including Change4Life – while also working with companies including Mars, KFC, PepsiCo and Walkers crisps. Experts claim that thousands by putting a health tax of 12p a can on sugary drinks . Researchers have claimed that rather than giving taxpayer funds to fast food firms, the government should be putting up the price of full sugar drinks like Coca-Cola and Pepsi. Experts at the University of Liverpool and the Children’s Food Campaign claim that thousands of cases of diabetes and cancer could be avoided, saving the NHS £300million, by putting a health tax of 12p a can on sugary drinks. The academics' work will fuel the growing campaign to extend the principle of a duty on unhealthy products from cigarettes and alcohol to some types of drink and food. Health campaigners and doctors have controversially likened sugar and its contribution to obesity and ill-health as the ‘new tobacco’. The Liverpool team calculates that a tax of 20p per litre – 12p per can – would reduce the number of cases of diabetes by just under 50,000 over 20 years. They estimate there would be a fall of 33,000 in cases of stroke and heart disease and some 9,000 fewer victims of bowel cancer. These figures relate to England alone and the researchers estimate it would lead to savings of £300m in the cost of treating these people over the 20 years, releasing money for other patients.","A study found thousands of pounds were being given to junk food firms .

88e78b62e31032bef10635fe9d14f92b27a1066c,"Melissa Brittle, 38, was sentenced to 20 years in prison for failing to report the abuse of her grandson . A Maryland woman who stood by while her husband horrifically whipped, shook and kicked his grandson to death has been sentenced to 20 years in prison. Prosecutors say Melissa Dawn Brittle, 38, of Thurmont, Maryland, encouraged husband Raymond Brittle to punish two-year-old Robert Dean Watkins - who was staying with the Brittles and their three children at the time. Robert died in a Washington, DC, hospital on September 8, 2013 following injuries that State's Attorney Charlie Smith called the most horrific he has ever seen, according to the Frederick News-Post. Mrs Brittle waited until the next day to take the unconscious boy to the hospital. She told police that Robert had fallen down the stairs. Mrs Brittle's lawyer argued that she was terrified of her emotionally abusive husband and intimidated into covering up his violence against little Robert. Defense attorney Mary Drawbaugh told Daily Mail Online that Brittle had no job, no high school diploma and no driver's license. 'We adamantly denied that she encouraged the child in any way,' Mrs Drawbaugh said. Raymond Brittle has admitted to horrifically beating two-year-old Robert Dean Watkins to death in September 2013. The Brittles were looking after the boy for his mother . 'She did come clean and cooperated with police and did facilitate a call to her husband in which he confessed to the crime.' Drawbaugh asked for a 12-year sentence, the lowest end of the sentencing spectrum for the case, arguing that Mrs Brittle helped bring about her husband's guilty plea and had been prepared to testify against him. Mrs Brittle faced up to 40 years in prison under a state law that says failing to report child abuse also constitutes child abuse. A judge on Wednesday ordered her held for 20 years, with 20 years suspended. Robert Dean Watkins was the step-grandson of Raymond Brittle. Raymond and Melissa has agreed to take care of the child for his mother . Raymond Brittle has also pleaded guilty in the child abuse case and faces 55 years in prison. He is scheduled to be sentenced next week. Prosecutors say he routinely beat and battered Robert while he was caring for his grandchild. On September 5, he became enraged at the boy when he wouldn't eat dinner. He whipped the children with a belt and kicked him. Investigators say he also lifted the boy by his head and shook him. An autopsy found that most of the boy's body was covered with bruises. He also had a fracture that covered three quarter of his skull and the injuries caused his brain to shift.","Melissa Brittle was sentenced under Maryland law that says failing to report child abuse also constitutes child abuse .

1a4bc7066a73d224b99c3775406d3eb6d30135e1,"An 85-year-old man has been plagued by non-stop egg attacks on his house for an entire year. Albert Clemens Senior’s home first became a target in March 2014, and the attacks have yet to stop, confounding neighbors, local government officials and even the police in Euclid, Ohio. Despite there being no let-up in the egg onslaught, no one has been able to identify the culprits. The attacks are ruining the elderly man’s green two-story house on the corner of Wilmore Avenue and East 210th Street which he bought with his wife almost 60 years ago. Clemens’ wife has passed away, but he continues to live in the house with his 51-year-old son and 49-year-old daughter. ‘The accuracy is phenomenal, because almost every time when it's nice weather and they launch five or six of these at a time, they almost invariably hit the front door,’ says Clemens. Dried egg residue covers the side of the house and has stripped away some of the paint. The police believe that the eggs are being launched from a block or two north of the home . The frequency is troubling too, as the house is pelted with eggs several times a week, occasionally more than once a day. The egg offensive always begins after dark and lasts about 10 minutes. The latest an attack has come is 2 a.m., and the noise as an egg hits the front door or aluminium siding of the house has been compared to the crack of a gunshot. Al Clemens Jr told Fox8 Cleveland that eggs are about 80 per cent of the items thrown at his home. There have also been apples, oranges, lemons, limes, grapefruits and canned goods. Dried egg residue covers the side of the house and has stripped away some of the paint. Albert Clemens Sr, 85, lives in the house with his 51-year-old son and 49-year-old daughter . The police believe that the eggs are being launched from a block or two north of the home and other than one or two mis-aimed eggs, few hit neighboring homes. ‘Somebody is deeply, deeply angry at somebody in that household for some reason,’ Euclid Lt. Mitch Houser told Cleveland.com. Local police are not taking the investigation lightly, trying undercover stakeouts, canvassing the neighbourhood, installing surveillance cameras, and even sending eggshells to a crime lab for testing. At one point the entire community policing unit was on the case. Luckily for police the home is less than a mile from the police station and officers are able to respond quickly to each attack. The finger has been pointed at a couple suspects in the neighborhood over the course of the year since the attacks began. Clemens was once confronted by a young man across the street who asked him to stop calling police about suspicious activity in the neighbourhood – suspected drug activity. Another nieghbor was suspected, but police saw him standing outside during an attack. The eggs have been traced back to a nearby Amish farm, but that yielded no further clues. Fingerprinting the eggs turned up nothing and the protein in eggs destroys any DNA evidence. Other lines of inquiry have suggested that the culprits are taking bad eggs from businesses that throw them away. The attacks are ruining the elderly man’s green two-story house on the corner of Wilmore Avenue and East 210th Street which he bought with his wife almost 60 years ago . The attacks have been so frequent that Clemens has been unable to keep up with the clean up . Officers visited local restaurants and outlets to ask about missing eggs. Neighbors have been questioned and fliers have been handed out, but nothing has turned up any leads. ‘The person or people who are doing it have remained very tight-lipped apparently,’ Houser said. ‘I would imagine it would be hard to keep a secret of something that had been done hundreds of times and for nobody to step forward to talk about it.’ Houser said he's never seen this level of vandalism in his 20 years of police work. Indeed police involvement seems to do nothing to deter the perpetrators. An officer was hit on the foot by an egg while he was at the house when an attack was launched. ""The man hours put into that investigation were huge and one of the reasons it's so frustrating that we don't have somebody right now that we can criminally charge,"" Houser said. A reward of $500 was offered, and that was then upped to $1,000, but still no one came forward. If caught, the culprit will be charged with felony vandalism and criminal damage, and officers are not ruling out hate crime charges if there is evidence. Clemens (pictured) is standing firm and has said he would never consider moving: ‘I like the neighbourhood. I like the city of Euclid. I would live and die in this house – but it's been kind of a nightmare’ Clemens used to clean up after each attack but hasn’t been able to keep up. Worse, his insurance company will not settle any claim until the attackers are stopped, so no repairs can be made. The harsh winter has offered some respite for the family, as the egg attacks became less frequent. However once warmer weather comes, both Clemens and Euclid police expect the eggings to start again. Clemens is standing firm and has said he would never consider moving from his beloved home despite the onslaught of eggs. ‘I like the neighbourhood. I like the city of Euclid.

bfebdda62b268586be9c75b1731348406a9a9187,"(CNN)The U.S. Navy doesn't just do stuff ""for fun,"" says the command master chief of the aircraft carrier USS Ronald Reagan, but what 30% of the ship's crew will be up to over the next year or so can at least be termed pretty cool. And it will certainly be unprecedented. Some 1,200 of the Reagan's crew will be executing what the Navy calls a three-hull swap, serving aboard three different carriers in one tour of duty as the service juggles assets to meet mission requirements. The 1,200 are calling themselves ""The Three Presidents Crew,"" as they will serve aboard three of the Navy's carriers named after presidents: the Reagan, the USS George Washington and the USS Theodore Roosevelt. The crew will even have its own insignia and hull number, CVN 220, the sum of the hull numbers of the Reagan (CVN 76), the Roosevelt (CVN 71) and the Washington (CVN 73). Mass Communication Specialist 3rd Class David Frederick aboard the Reagan came up with the logo. ""I am honored that my art will be a part of the legacy of this 'Three Presidents' crew, and I hope that it will bring attention to the hard work of all the Sailors who are involved in this crew swap,"" he said. The swap will begin this summer. The George Washington will go from its home port in Japan to San Diego, where a crew swap with the Reagan will take place. While the George Washington crew takes the Reagan to replace the Washington in Japan, the Three Presidents crew will board the George Washington, which will be headed for Norfolk, Virginia, and an overhaul. The 1,200 will sail with the Washington around South America, then they will fly back to San Diego to crew the Roosevelt, which is taking the Reagan's current spot there. ""Think of how difficult a three-hull carrier swap would be to carry out,"" Capt. Chris Bolt, the commander of the Reagan, said in the ship's publication, The 76er. ""It's never been done before."" ""We are just moving assets around so we can continue to meet mission requirements. That's exactly what this is all about. It's not because the Navy said, 'Let's do this for fun,' "" Spike Call, command master chief of the Reagan, said in The 76er. Seven of the Navy's 10 active aircraft carriers are named after presidents. As one commenter on the Reagan's Facebook page said, maybe next time, the Navy could add a fourth carrier to the hull swap and come up with ... the USS Mount Rushmore. Hmmm, the Navy does have the USS Abraham Lincoln (CVN 72), but there is no carrier for Jefferson. So say we sub in the Reagan and come up with CVN 292.

75c7ee365e053b36d6b65deccc74d5bcd555f41f,"One of Australia's most popular pain killers has been left with a splitting headache, as the national consumer watchdog gets ready to take it to court. Reckitt Benckiser, the company behind Nurofen in Australia, will square off against the Australian Competition and Consumer Commission (ACCC) in federal court this month over claims that it has mislead customers. The ACCC will dispute claims made by the company that the Nurofen Specific Pain Range is specially designed to target different types of pain. The consumer watchdog claims that all products contain identical ingredients. Scroll down for video . Australia's consumer watchdog is taking Nurofen to court over its advertising claiming its products target  specific types of pain . The products in question are: Nurofen Back Pain, Nurofen Period Pain, Nurofen Migraine Pain and Nurofen Tension Headache. ACCC Chairman Rod Sims said cracking down on false advertising surrounding medical products was a targetted priority for the watchdog. 'The ACCC takes false or misleading claims about the efficacy of health and medical products very seriously,' Mr Sims said. 'In this case, we allege that consumers have been misled into purchasing Nurofen Specific Pain Products under the belief that each product is specifically designed for and effective in treating a particular type of pain, when this is not the case.' 'The ACCC takes false or misleading claims about the efficacy of health and medical products very seriously,' chairman Rod Sims said. It also flagged the 'significantly' higher cost of Nurofen compared to other products as a concern, with the range in question costing up to twice as much as a standard pain killer sold by Nurofen or another comparable brand. A Nurofen spokeswoman denied the allegations in a statement, and said pain-specific products made life easier for customers. 'Nurofen is committed to the quality use of medicines and promoting and protecting the health of Australians,' the statement read. 'Nurofen works closely with all regulatory bodies to ensure high standards compliance to guidelines. 'Nurofen will continue to work with regulators to ensure its packaging continues to be fully aligned with all guidelines and requirements and still offer consumers with clear pain relief options for their pain type.' The ACCC is seeking declarations, injunctions, an order for the publication of corrective notices, penalties and costs.

f762fc3d2540077faeac60a4ca41990e24c3343b,"An FBI agent who was supposed to be upholding the law was busted on 64 counts in a drug tampering case after he stole heroin from investigations and overdosed in an unmarked police car. Matthew Lowry, 33, a heroin-addicted former special agent in the Washington field office tampered with hundreds of grams of heroin seized during drug investigations in 2013 and 2014. He was investigated by the  Department of Justice after  he was found slumped over and unconscious  in his unmarked FBI vehicle from a heroin overdose on September 29. Car: Matthew Lowry, formerly a special agent with the agency's Washington field office was investigated after he was found unconscious in his unmarked FBI vehicle, pictured, on September 29 after overdosing on heroin . Heroin: Bags of heroin, pictured, were recovered from the FBI agent's vehicle where he kept drugs in his car for weeks or months, and used it periodically . According to authorities, Lowry, a married father of one, allegedly took drugs that had been processed as evidence, removed heroin from evidence bags, and then added a cutting agent to account for the missing weight. He used a dietary supplement or a laxative as the cutting agents. Lowry then kept the bags of heroin in his car for weeks or months, and used it periodically, according to charging documents filed in federal court in Washington, D.C., on Friday. His crimes were fueled by an addiction to prescription painkillers, but his dishonesty botched dozens of cases involving suspected drug traffickers in multiple states. In one case, charges were dropped against 14 defendants suspected to be involved with a large-scale drug-trafficking organization that was the subject of a major FBI investigation in California. The investigation included court-ordered wiretaps, physical surveillance and numerous controlled drug buys, time-consuming and costly investigative techniques. Theft: Documents revealed that Lowry took heroin he got during controlled buys as part of FBI investigations . Attorney: Robert Bonsib said Lowry will plead guilty to 64 charges of obstruction of justice, heroin possession and conversion of property. He could face at least seven years in prison . Additionally, his actions caused federal prosecutors to dismiss charges against at least 28 defendants in drug cases. They also had to notify 150 more that Lowry had participated in investigations targeting them. Attorney Robert Bonsib said Lowry will plead guilty to 64 charges of obstruction of justice, heroin possession and conversion of property. He could face at least seven years in prison. Meanwhile, documents revealed that the former FBI agent took heroin he got during controlled buys as part of FBI investigations. Evidence: Lowry removed small amounts of heroin from evidence packages to self-medicate his health issue known as ulcerative colitis . Bonsib said in each of 20 incidents involving evidence tampering, Lowry removed small amounts of heroin from evidence packages to self-medicate his health issue known as ulcerative colitis. One of Lowry's doctors had prescribed him powerful pain medications without warning him of how addictive they were, Bonsib said. When his doctor left the practice without notice, Lowry tried to kick the addiction but it was 'overpowering' and the pain from his medical condition was 'unbearable.' Bonsib added: 'Mr Lowry recognizes the importance of taking full responsibility for each of his acts and he also recognizes the need to account to the public for his misconduct.' 'He is devastated by the consequences of his conduct, particularly as it has affected the drug investigations that he, his fellow law enforcement officers, and prosecutors had spent so much time developing and pursing.' 'The fact that his conduct has damaged the ability of some of those investigations to be successfully prosecuted is contrary to everything he trained himself for and believes in,' he said. Bonsib described the night Lowry was found unconscious in his car as a 'turning point.' He immediately  met with prosecutors and investigators to help investigate his conduct. He also sought treatment for his addiction. The case is being prosecuted by federal attorneys in Pennsylvania. Lowry wanted to be a law enforcement officer to follow in the footsteps of his father,  a narcotics investigator for Prince George's Police and assistant chief of Anne Arundel County Police.","Matthew Lowry, 33, a former special agent tampered with FBI drugs cases .

4b038fc766179585a64a1c87a4f103444cb1719c,"The Ministry of Defence was last year forced to pay out more than £1million a month in compensation claims for bureaucrats injured at work, new figures reveal. In the last year alone the MoD paid out £13.5million in compensation to civilian staff – which amounts to almost a third of the £45million given to serving soldiers. It means that for every £3,000 paid  to injured soldiers the government handed £1,000 to MoD bureaucrats for office falls, according to the figures released under freedom of information rules. While soldiers in Afghanistan have risked their lives fighting the Taliban, MoD staff stationed in the UK are constantly being carted off to hospital for trips, falls, crashes and bizarre health and safety incidents. Soldiers, pictured attending the annual Irish Guards St Patrick's Day Parade in Aldershot this week, have received £45million in compensation last year - but another £13.5million was paid to bureaucrats . The details of the catalogue of mishaps to befall military personnel in the UK were revealed by safety officers who have had to record all serious incidents for the Health and Safety Executive. Although there were parachuting, roping and other training course injuries sustained by military personnel last year there were also a host of more mundane office based accidents. In one, a man rushed back into his office to answer the phone on his desk only to trip over a hidden vacuum cleaner. The person smashed into a rubbish bin and their office chair and needed a week off work to recover from the injuries. Another person was walking out of a meeting when they were distracted by a colleague and ended up walking into a wall and breaking their wrist. One person hurt their back when the legs on the right side of their chair snapped off sending the person toppling onto the floor. In a similar incident a roller came off one of the legs of a moveable office chair sending the person who was sitting in it crashing to the floor. A member of the public who was visiting a recreation of a World War I trench ended up in hospital with a gash to their head when they stood on a crate to get a view over the top and toppled back over. In a separate case a group of cadets were injured when the camping gas canister they were using to cook a meal exploded, leaving one girl with bad burns. Defence Secretary Michael Fallon was last year forced to pay out more than £1million a month in compensation claims for bureaucrats injured at work, new figures reveal . Another MOD worker was off work for more than a month after they injured their bladder in a slip on the newly cleaned floor of the office toilets, while a dog handler suffered bad cuts after trying to separate a fight between two military dogs. All the incidents were recorded on RIDDOR forms which the Health and Safety Executive make organisations fill out when there has been a serious injury in the workplace or a dangerous incident that could have led to an accident. An MOD spokesperson said: 'MOD has a duty of care to all its employees whether military or civilian personnel. 'Claims brought for civil damages are considered on the basis of complex legal liability and where liability is proved compensation is paid but we robustly resist spurious claims. 'The amount of compensation is determined by common law principles and payments are often made to those who have suffered the most severe injuries in the course of their work.'","In the last year the MoD paid out £13.5m in compensation to civilian staff .

06c202f5d2abb2254fe5afcc70deb5d38ff23535,"The Conservatives will build 200,000 cut-price homes to help first-time buyers get a foot on the property ladder, David Cameron will pledge today. A scheme offering starter homes for sale at 20 per cent below the normal market price is to be doubled in size if the Tories win the election. The estimated discount on a typical £200,000 house would be a hefty £40,000. Scroll down for video . Levels of home ownership have plummeted to the lowest level in 30 years, according to latest figures . The scheme for 100,000 such homes was announced at the Conservative Party conference in September. The Prime Minister now wants to build 200,000 over the next five years. Pledging to produce a Britain ‘where everyone who works hard can have a home of their own’, Mr Cameron will say: ‘There is a particular kind of security that comes with having a home – and that’s what I want to talk about today. Too many people have been denied that security. ‘The young people in their 20s and 30s, still living with their parents, desperately saving for their own place. The couple who want a child but can’t afford to upsize – even though they both have full-on, full-time jobs. It shouldn’t be this way.’ David Cameron will pledge to build 200,000 cut-price homes to help first-time buyers get a foot on the property ladder . The move comes amid concern over falling levels of home ownership and the prospect that future generations may never be able to afford a home of their own. Mr Cameron is also considering a radical idea tabled by Work and Pensions Secretary Iain Duncan Smith to extend the right to buy to 2.5million tenants in housing association properties. The Tories’ Starter Homes initiative is due to begin today. First-time buyers aged under 40 are eligible to apply and can register their interest at www.starter-home.co.uk. The homes will be built by the private sector and several major developers such as Barratt and Taylor Wimpey have signed up to take part. Anyone buying one will have to hang on to it for at least five years before selling it on the open market to prevent speculators using the scheme to make a windfall profit. Ministers are consulting on whether to extend the minimum resale period to 15 years. Labour last night attacked the Tory housing plan after Conservative Party chairman Grant Shapps struggled to explain how it would be funded. In an interview with Sky News Mr Shapps initially suggested homebuyers would be offered government-subsidised mortgages, before saying ministers would ‘get together’ with developers and landowners to finalise details. Shadow housing minister Emma Reynolds said the comments suggested the Conservatives’ plans were not credible. ‘The Tories’ housing policies are in chaos,’ she said. ‘Grant Shapps, a former housing minister, couldn’t even explain how the Government would deliver a key election pledge.’ But Tory sources said there was a clear plan to keep prices down by allowing construction in areas where planning permission would not normally be granted for housing. Hundreds of acres of unwanted commercial and industrial land are to be turned over for the scheme, which Mr Cameron has said will help ‘unlock home ownership for a generation’. In some cases, developers will be allowed to build a small number of homes for sale on the open market to subsidise the cost of the new starter homes. Developers will also be spared infrastructure levies which add about £20,000 to the cost of a home on a normal development. Rules allowing homeowners to build conservatories without planning permission are to be extended . Controversial rules that allow homeowners to build big conservatories and extensions without planning permission are to be extended for another five years, the Tories said yesterday. The regulations, which permit extensions of up to 26ft long without authorisation – provided no neighbours object – provoked a major row when they were first announced by the Government in 2013. But Tory sources said they would be retained until at least 2020. Regulations which make it easier for former offices to be converted to homes would also be extended. Conservative Party Chairman Grant Shapps said that the move was designed to ensure ‘common sense on home extensions, so families aren’t crushed by expensive red tape’. Councils will also be forced to help find plots for people seeking to build their own homes, as part of a scheme that ministers believe could produce up to 20,000 new homes a year. Ministers say they want to offer new starter homes in both towns and the countryside – and it is possible that some will be built in the Green Belt. The price of homes available in the scheme will be capped at £250,000 outside London and £450,000 in the capital. Mr Cameron will pledge that design standards will not be allowed to slip, saying that people will not be offered ‘rabbit hutches or shoe boxes, but decent, well-built homes with gardens – places to start and raise a family’. But industry sources questioned whether the scheme could be delivered and pointed out that it has been doubled in size before a single home has been built. One senior industry figure described the target for 200,000 cut-price homes over five years as ‘very ambitious’ in the context of the 125,000 or so new houses started in total last year.","David Cameron to announce housing policy in speech in today .

The Hammers head across London looking to kickstart their Premier League campaign, having plummeted down to 10th place after no wins in the last six and back-to-back defeats. Arsenal, meanwhile, have surged back into the top four and are into the FA Cup semi-finals after beating Manchester United at Old Trafford on Monday night. Alex Song believes West Ham can kickstart their Premier League campaign against Arsenal on Sunday . Despite Arsenal's formidable run of seven consecutive home victories in the Premier League, Song - who played for the Gunners between 2005 and 2012, before joining Barcelona - believes the Irons can repeat Monaco's performance after the unfancied French side stunned the Emirates Stadium with a 3-1 Champions League victory last month. 'I know this stadium very well and I know when you play with Arsenal it's very hard, but I think Monaco is how you want to play when you play in the Emirates,' Song told the West Ham website, www.whufc.com. 'The best thing to do is to try to be together, defend together very well and when you have the opportunity to go on the counter attack, you have to do it very well like Monaco did it. Song played for the Gunners between 2005 and 2012 before joining Barcelona . 'If you want to go to Emirates and try to play you will not have any chance to win the game there because this stadium is very hard to play in. 'You have to stay together very compact and not give them any room, then take the opportunity on the counter attack. 'If we do this very well like Monaco did, then we can get a good result there.' Song, the 27-year-old on loan from Barcelona until the end of the season, feels the Irons can raise their game against Arsenal. 'We have shown a lot of things this season as a team, especially when we play against teams at the highest level like Manchester City and Liverpool or Tottenham. We've done very well and we need to continue to improve in this way,' said Song, who stayed in London to work on his fitness while the rest of the squad were away at a warm-weather camp in Dubai. The 27-year-old feels West Ham can raise their game against Arsenal in the same way Monaco did . 'We can play better and hopefully this game on Saturday will be a very good test for us. 'It has been a long time since we won a game in the league, so we must try to come back and try to win or get one point there. 'Everything is possible in football and we just need to keep believing and trying hard on the pitch.' Song maintains there can be no room for sentiment against his former club. 'They are one part of my life and, because I went there when I was 17, I always say it is my family,' the former Cameroon international said. 'I know this is a special game for me, but that is football and I have to take all the emotion out and just try to play my game, to play the best football I can to help the team to win.'","West Ham have plummeted down to 10th place in the Premier League table .

But while Aidan Turner was unknown to many prior to his turn as the troubled Ross Poldark in the BBC drama of the same name, the 31-year-old is no stranger to success. Yet although he may look familiar to some, others might find him hard to place - unless you're a fan of fantasy films and supernatural drama that is. Turner plays Ross Poldark who's lost his love, Elizabeth (played by Heida Reed, left) to another man . Irish actor Aidan Turner, who plays dashing Captain Ross Poldark, sets pulses racing on the BBC show . For before donning the tricorn hat and brooding scowl of the landowner who returns to Cornwall to find his true love is engaged to another man, Turner was busy fighting evil in Middle Earth. The 5ft 10in Turner was digitally shrunk for his role as Kili, one of two dwarf brothers who set out alongside Thorin Oakenshield and Bilbo Baggins in a quest to reclaim the Lonely Mountain in Peter Jackson's Hobbit trilogy. But with Martin Freeman playing Bilbo Baggins and Richard Armitage's brooding dwarf chieftan stealing all the screen thunder, you might have missed Aidan's fantastical role - had he not also enjoyed a plotline that involved flirting with Tauriel the elf, played by Evangeline Lilly. Action stations: From left, John Callen, Dean O'Gorman, Aidan Turner, William Kircher, James Nesbitt, Adam Brown, Jed Brophy, Peter Hambleton, Ken Stott and Stephen Hunter in a scene from The Hobbit: the Battle of the Five Armies film . He became famous as vampire John Mitchell in the BBC3 supernatural housemates dramedy Being Human . But it seems training to play the warrior dwarf may have helped sculpt the abs that have become famous in their own right. Turner told Empire about the prep needed for the trilogy: 'A lot of going to the gym; a lot of movement classes. Dwarves are just weighed down by everything,' he said. 'They’re not sluggish, they just have this work-horse mentality. When they get going they’re unstoppable.' Turner even popped up in The Tudors in one episode as a richly-dressed character called Bedoli . As John Schofield, Hattie Jacques' lodger and lover, Turner had to don Sixties clothing . Aidan Turner and Dean O'Gorman as brothers Kili and Fili respectively in a scene from The Hobbit: An Unexpected Journey . Since graduating from The Gaiety School of Acting in 2004, the Dubliner has enjoyed an eclectic range of parts and notched up a number of award nominations. His career in television began in 2007 when he embraced 16th century-style costume to appear in one episode of the television series The Tudors. More period work was to follow when he was chosen to play pre-Raphaelite painter Dante Gabriel Rossetti in the six-part BBC series the Desperate Romantics, followed swiftly by appearances as Ruairí McGowan on The Clinic. But Turner finally had a change of pace in 2008 when he was cast as the undead John Mitchell in the supernatural drama Being Human, about a werewolf, vampire and a ghost who share a house. With his hair slicked back, his face deathly pale, an all-black wardrobe and a set of menacing fangs, the actor earned a new army of fans.

The great religious fissure between Sunni and Shia Muslims that dominates the Middle East has erupted into open conflict  in Yemen, the region’s poorest country, threatening to engulf the entire area in a wider war. In a dramatic escalation of the stakes, a Sunni coalition of Arab states led by Saudi Arabia launched airstrikes against Iran-backed Shia Houthi rebels who have swept south through the country. As Yemen veered towards political disintegration, the conflict exploded into a region-wide crisis that could have far-reaching and unpredictable international consequences. Scroll down for video . Saudi Arabia launched airstrikes against Iran-backed Shia Houthi rebels, pictured people  gather at the site of an explosion near Sana'a Airport . Brent crude oil prices increased by 6 per cent, for example, since many of the world’s oil shipments pass through or past the Bab el-Mandab Strait linking the Red Sea with the Gulf of Aden. But the far more pressing concern is whether we are now seeing a proxy war in Yemen between its neighbour Saudi Arabia, the leading Sunni power, and Iran, the leading Shia power, explode into a regional conflict that could sweep us all up in its wake. Saudi warplanes targeted Houthi positions in the country’s capital Sana’a killing 18 civilians and injuring many more. Britain and America supported the Saudi-led military intervention in Yemen as the coalition deployed 100 fighter jets and amassed 150,000 soldiers to fight in the region. Another nine Sunni states joined the offensive, including the United Arab Emirates, Kuwait and Qatar, pledging to send aircraft to bomb targets, with Egypt deploying ships. Anticipating the worsening situation, British elite soldiers — in Yemen to train government troops to fight Al Qaeda, which has established its most dangerous branch in the country — pulled out last Friday. This followed a decision by the U .S. to evacuate their remaining military personnel as the country teetered on the brink of civil war between the internationally recognised government of President Abdrabbuh Mansour Hadi and the Houthi rebels. As Western forces left, the rebels — trained, armed and funded by Iran — made further advances in the south of the country. The Yemeni president, who is backed by the U.N., was forced to flee his palace in the former British colonial port of Aden on the southern coast and there were reports last night that he had left by boat for the Saudi capital, Riyadh. This week, Aden — once one of the British Empire’s most important ports for ships heading to imperial India, and a haven of stability patrolled by officers in pith helmets and colonial shorts — was raked with the sound of gunfire. Just 35 miles to the north, Shia rebels had seized Al Anad air base, which until recently had been used by American counter-terrorism forces to fight terrorists. Yemen sits on the extreme end of the Arabian peninsula, with Saudi Arabia to the north — where the 150,000 Saudi troops are now amassing on its border. An armed member of Houthi militia stands over the rubble of houses which were allegedly destroyed by a Saudi air strike in Sana'a, Yemen . A fierce, tribal society, Yemen has long been torn apart by tribal conflicts. Governing the country has been compared with dancing on the heads of snakes. The Houthis — who belong to a relatively obscure branch of Shia Islam — were largely confined to the north of the country and were contained by the country’s longtime president, Ali Abdullah Saleh, a wily Arab strongman, until he was overthrown in the course of the Arab Spring in 2011. President Hadi, his weaker successor, never managed to reassert central control, and in September the Houthis took control of the capital Sana’a. In the vacuum created by President Hadi’s weak leadership, Iran saw the opportunity to taunt its old rival by backing the Houthis and establishing its influence in the Saudis’ backyard. But the recent Houthi advances have proved too much for Saudi, whose primary aim is to re-establish order in Yemen. It amassed a formidable coalition — Egypt, Jordan, Sudan, Morocco, Pakistan, United Arab Emirates, Qatar, Kuwait and Egypt — of Sunni-led states and sent in its fighter jets to send a powerful message to Iran: stop meddling in Arab affairs. The Saudis also regard Iran’s influence in Yemen as evidence of a much larger drive by Shia Iran for regional dominance. They claim that Iran is using armed proxies to take over other states. Nothing happens in Lebanon, for instance, without the approval of the Iranian-backed Shia militia Hizbollah, which also provides Syria’s beleaguered President Assad with his light infantry. Houthi fighters manning a heavy machine gun fixed on the back of a pick-up guard a rally protesting Saudi-led airstrikes . For its part, Iran has condemned the air strikes. Foreign Ministry spokeswoman Marzieh Afkham said the country ‘considers this action a dangerous step’, adding that military action would complicate and worsen the crisis in Yemen. ‘This invasion will bear no result but expansion of terrorism and extremism throughout the whole region,’ she said. And the truth is that she may well be right. Yemen has a chronic terrorism problem, simply because such a failed state is an ideal operating ground for terrorists. Yemen is not only home to the most tactically lethal branch of Al Qaeda but now ISIS has a foothold there too. On March 20 four ISIS suicide bombers killed 137 Shia outside their mosques in Sana’a. Before the U.S. military moved out of the country, they were allowed to launch drone strikes on Al Qaeda. But now, in their absence, terrorists are no longer being targeted so effectively, and will only flourish as a result. To make matters still more precarious for the West in its fight against terror, Iran and the Shia militias it backs are proving an increasingly vital component of the ground war against ISIS in Iraq, with Iranian commanders directing them and supplying them too. This means the West is walking on diplomatic eggshells. What if Iran took over much of Iraq, whose government and population is largely Shia as well? Would the Saudis stand for that? And if a Shia Houthi government succeeds in Yemen, then wouldn’t Saudi Arabia’s own downtrodden Shia population, some 10-15 per cent of them in the kingdom’s oil-rich Eastern Province, want some independence? The western response to this chaos is understandably hesitant. Washington is unsure whether Iranian strategy is really to establish proxy Shia governments all over the region or simply to use the Houthi in Yemen to taunt Saudi Arabia and pacify the country’s own hardliners. We now have a bizarre — and potentially very dangerous — situation in which U.S. warplanes are providing air cover for Iranian-backed militias in Iraq in a joint effort against ISIS, while 1,200 miles to the south in Yemen, the Americans are helping Saudi pilots bomb Shia insurgents supported by Iran. So the U.S. is bombing Iran’s enemies in one country, while helping to bomb its allies in another. On top of all this, American and Iranian diplomats are resuming their talks about how to restrain Tehran’s nuclear programme. Such is the chaotic and complex nature of affairs in the Middle East. And as the Saudis pledge to resolve their own local difficulty, we can only hold our breath.","Religious fissure between Sunni and Shia Muslims erupted into conflict .

9b86d5045e5e0a361cec8aa70524664fea10f098,"A Chinese man who has been left with a memory that lasts just five minutes has found the only way he can cope is to continually write down every detail of his life in a precious notebook. Chen Hongzhi, 25, from Hsinchu county, Beipu, suffered a serious head injury in a car accident when he was a teenager which has left him with virtually no memory, The People's Daily reports. He writes down everything - from the people he meets in the street to the weather - as his injury means he has to start from scratch each day. Memory book: Chen Hongzhi uses the notebook to write down people he meets and what he does each day after being left with a five-minute memory following a car crash . Chen suffered the severe brain injury in a car accident when he was 17 and spent months in intensive care in hospital. While his body recovered, his memory loss is still so severe that he often forgets things that happened between five and 10 minutes ago. The debilitating condition also means that Chen cannot remember how to write properly, so he makes notes in a phonetic 'scrawl' that mostly only he understands. 'This is my record, I write in it everyday, even if it is pouring down with rain or if I don't go out to do the weeding I still l must write, ""Heavy rain"",' he said. 'Whenever I get home from any time away  I quickly grab my notebook and write down important things from the day - who I've met, what I've done, how much money I got from recycling bottles, all that sort of stuff.' Life record: Chen writes down everything from the people he meets in the street to the weather as his injury means he has to start from scratch each day. He has even developed his own language . Dependants: Chen Hongzhi with his mother Wang Miao-chiong, who starts the day by handing Chen his notebook and reminding him he is no-longer 17. They are reliant on each other following the recent death of his father . Every day when Chen wakes up, his mother, Wang Miao-chiong, must remind him that he is no longer 17 and eight years have passed. She hands him the notebook so he can read what has happened in his life since the accident and check important details like who his friends are and what needs to be done that day. Chen's story has spread online in China after it was compared to that of the fictional character played by Nicole Kidman in the film Before I Go to Sleep. His condition means Chen is unable to hold down a job so he raises a small amount of money by walking several kilometres collecting plastic bottles. Chen also collects wood that he and his mother use to make a fire to cook their food. His mother, 60, said the practical system has kept Chen going for years, but she worries about what will happen to him after she has gone, particularly given the recent death of his father. Guide to life: Chen Hongzhi, 25, has had to write everything down after he suffered brain injuries that left him with a five-minute memory, when he was 17 . They get by on donations from neighbours and friends in the tiny village in northern Taiwan's Hsinchu County, who have given Chen the nickname 'short memory man' because he forgets having met them within 24 hours. She said the family had initially hoped he would go back to school but soon realised there would be little point. 'It had been planned that would go back to school but there was no point as he could never remember the lessons, and has been living at home with me ever since.' Before the accident: Chen poses with a pony before a car accident left him with very little memory . Hard worker: Despite having very little memory, Chen collects firewood for his family to use in the stove . The pair are totally dependent on each other, with Chen having his mother there to reassure him about who he is and he, in turn, provides the physical strength to earn the money and carry out the household chores. A severe hit to the head can injure the brain and cause both short and long-term memory loss. Memory is easily damaged by brain injury because there are several structures in the brain are involved in processing information, storing it and retrieving it. Damage to those parts of the brain can result in memory loss. Head injuries can trigger memory loss of the period immediately after the accident. A person can appear to be relatively well, but everyday memory for events or conversations can be interrupted. They can also forget the time from before the brain injury – called retrograde and anteretrograde amnesia – and the gap in memory will range from a few minutes to a few months. But the most common – and the most troublesome - type of memory loss is short term memory loss. This can manifest itself in a variety of ways. Examples of this are forgetting what has just been said, having difficulty in learning a new skill, repeating the same question over and over, forgetting people's names, getting details mixed up, forgetting a change in routine and forgetting where things have been placed. There is no guaranteed cure for this type of memory problem, and rehabilitation will try to help a person cope using tried and tested strategies. However, memory is not like a muscle that can be developed just by stretching it. Source: Headway: The Brain Injury Association . After the death of his father, he was forced to step up his bottle collecting activities, where he was spotted by a traveller who was fascinated by his story, and posted on social media where it quickly spread. Beipu village chief, Liu Chin-ting, said the family receives monthly support from Hsinchu County's social welfare department, which is helping the family to get by. Welfare workers also make it a point to visit Chen and his mother during festive holidays, he said. But Liu said he believes the boy could still have a future if there was a medical facility that was prepared to take in and give him proper physiotherapy and training. He said: 'He needs to get some preparation because his mother won't be there forever, and maybe they can get to the point where he can even hold down a regular job'. The family have been flooded with offers of people wanting to send money but Chief Liu, who is helping to negotiate, said what they really need now is is practical everyday donations like tissue paper, rice, salt and soy sauce. He said: 'Once the basics are sorted out, perhaps it might be possible to look at taking the time to find something more for the mid-term and long-term, but at the moment they just need to survive.' Chen meanwhile is clearly happy, as his diary notes that kind donations of money have been flooding in and he's very happy that people want to help. He knows he is destined to forget everything, but also knows that nothing he can do about that except keep his sense of humour. He said: 'I am reading here about all the people that want to give me money, but I would say don't give me too much, because it looks as if I'll probably forget where I put it all.' In the film Before I Go to Sleep, 40-year-old Christine Lucas, played by Nicole Kidman lives a life where she wakes up every day forgetting what has gone on the day before. In a remarkable similarity, she has to remind herself by writing notes each day about what has happened to her since the car accident. Alike: Chen's story has led to comparisons between himself and Holywood blockbuster Before I Go to Sleep (2014), starring Nicole Kidman as Christine Lucas and Colin Firth as Ben Lucas .","Car crash left Chen Hongzhi with severe brain injuries and little memory .

Chelsey Dunn, 26, was mortified when her partner compared her underwear to that of cross-dressing nanny Mrs Doubtfire. She had long considered a breast augmentation and says the unflattering comparison was the final straw. Chelsey Dunn, pictured after her breast enlargement, went under the knife her partner, Ross Stephens, left, jokingly compared her padded underwear to Mrs Doubtfire's . Months after the remark, she was boosted from a 34A to a 34DD at a cost of £5,500 and is now delighted to have been able to throw away her old underwear. Miss Dunn, who is now engaged to marry her partner after he proposed following her surgery said: ‘It was just a joke to make me laugh but I had to admit it was true. 'I wanted to be able to wear nice lingerie and backless clothes but I couldn’t because I felt out of proportion without my padded bra on.' Chelsea, pictured at a 34A, had long considered a breast augmentation and says the unflattering comparison was the final straw . She underwent the operation in January last year and was boosted to a 34DD . Miss Dunn, from Rhyl, South Wales, had been teased over her lack of curves at school and was unkindly nicknamed the ‘ironing board.’ She says she longed for her bust to grow and hoped she was just a late developer, but by her early twenties she was used to concealing her bust. She said: ‘I would buy the thickest padded bras I could find. My friends all joked that they looked like mattress padding. 'For some reason thick padded bras are always beige. They are the most unattractive garments but without them I felt self-conscious.' Months after her operation, her boyfriend proposed in the Disney Princess Castle while the couple were holidaying in Florida and Miss Dunn accepted . It meant she was limited to clothing that she could wear to conceal the bras. She said: ‘Holidays were tricky because I couldn’t wear my padded bra under bikinis and longed to wear strapless and backless dresses like my friends but it was impossible. It was when she was undressing in front of her boyfriend that he teasingly asked her if Mrs Doubtfire wanted her bra back soon that she decided it was time to do something about it. She said: 'It was really funny because I was the first to admit my padded bras were not sexy in the slightest. But it did also make me think enough was enough. My chest had always bothered me why not do something about it?’ She booked a consultation with Transform and her surgeon agreed to boost her from an A to a DD cup.

But in fact, the 33-foot-long bunker built under one of Toronto's most important tourist attractions was 'just a place to hang out', according to its architect. Elton McDonald, 22, has finally unveiled himself as the man behind the mysterious tunnel which took five years to construct. And his pursuits were far from cunning. Scroll down for video . Just for fun! Construction worker Elton McDonald, 22, says he built the underground bunker to watch TV in . Fears: Investigators first thought the 33-foot-long tunnel underneath Toronto could be part of a terror plot . 'Innocent': McDonald says he and a friend spent five years constructing the wood-paneled space underground . 'It wasn't really a tunnel. I was going to expand it to have a couple of rooms,' McDonald, a construction worker, told the Toronto Sun newspaper. 'I was hoping to put in a TV. I did some barbecuing in there. It was more a place to hang out.' Police ignited a frenzy of media speculation in February by announcing the discovery of a 'sophisticated' hand-dug tunnel near a tennis stadium to be used for the Pan Am Games in July. Much of the speculation was linked to concern about a terrorist plot against the Games. McDonald said he'd begun working in construction at age 17 and considered it a fun challenge to dig the hideout with several friends. He told his family about it so they understood why he was always so dirty . The site: The bunker is underneath tennis courts where the Pan American Games will be hosted this year . McDonald says he had grand plans to add rooms to the underground 'hang out' space in Toronto . Days later, police said they had identified two men who had built the  tunnel but declined to reveal their identities since no crime had been committed. McDonald told the newspaper he'd begun working in construction at age 17 and considered it a fun challenge to dig the hideout with several friends. He told his family about the project so they would understand why he came home so dirty. When news broke about the tunnel, McDonald said he didn't speak up because he was afraid he'd be in trouble. Police tracked him down after his employer recognized some of the equipment used at the site, McDonald said. Suspicious: Police were baffled to find a rosary and poppy on the door but McDonald says it was a gift . Investigation: Police launched a large-scale investigation into the bunker when it was discovered in January . The tunnel was discovered January 14 in a suburban woodlot. Reinforced with wooden walls and ceiling supports, it had electricity supplied by a generator, a sump pump to remove water and a pulley system to remove dirt. Police found a rosary with crucifix and a poppy nailed to one of the tunnel's wooden supports. McDonald said his sister gave him the crucifix for good luck after a small cave-in, while he'd found the poppy on Remembrance Day, November 11, when war veterans are honored. Canada has been on heightened alert for terrorist activity since a gunman attacked the Parliament Buildings in Ottawa in October after fatally shooting a soldier at the nearby National War Memorial. The attack by a so-called 'lone wolf' Canadian convert to Islam came two days after another convert rammed two soldiers in Quebec with his car, killing one.","Elton McDonald, 22, says he built the tunnel to watch TV and barbecue .

Poyet was dismissed for kicking over a cooler box before clashing on the touchline with Bruce. The rival bosses were only kept apart by the assistant referee and both could face further sanction should the FA investigate the clash which was sparked when Poyet sarcastically applauded in Bruce’s face. But the Uruguayan blamed Dean for his reaction after he booked Jack Rodwell for diving. Poyet said: ‘Kicking a bottle of water is nothing serious. ‘I was not happy with Paul McShane (Hull defender) dancing like he was in the theatre, or like he’d been shot, and won a free-kick before that. ‘Jack then dived and got a free-kick against him, I just want fairness. ‘I have no regrets whatsoever. I now have to convince the officials not to put buckets of drinks around me.’ Jack Rodwell appeals for a foul but is booked for diving, a decision that led to Poyet's reaction . The two managers are restrained by match officials who try desperately to keep them away from each other . As the pair locked horns Bruce makes sure he gets his point across by bellowing in Poyet's direction . Poyet's side were lucky to escape with a point and will be fined £25,000 by the FA after six of their players were booked, including Lee Cattermole who picked up a two-game ban following his 10th yellow of the season. Bruce, meanwhile, did not reveal what Poyet had said to provoke his furious reaction. But he admitted it had been unsavoury. ‘I think it’s right that I keep what he said to myself,’ he said. ‘But it wasn’t very pleasant. It wasn’t “have a nice evening, Steve”. ‘But I don’t know why I reacted like that. We all do stupid things but it was handbags. ‘I thank the assistant referee for stepping in. I’ll have to buy him a beer. ‘I just think Gus had seen it differently about Rodwell diving. But the referee got it right. ‘All I said to his assistant was that Rodwell had dived. ‘These things happen in the heat of the moment. Grown men acting like a couple of children. They happen in big games. Let’s forget about it and go and have a glass of wine.’ Poyet was sent to the stands for his antics and could face further punishment after the game . The 47-year-old watches on with interest as his side searched for the equaliser at the KC Stadium . The result moves Hull five points clear of the relegation zone with Sunderland a point behind. And Bruce said: ‘We’re making a fist of it and I would say that is a point gained. We’re six clear of the relegation zone now if you take into account our goal difference. ‘We have to remember it’s our second season in the league. For Sunderland they’ve been there for eight.’ Dame N’Doye opened the scoring in the first half before Rodwell levelled late on, although the ball appeared to go in via his arm. Bruce said: ‘I didn’t see it to be honest, but if Rodwell has said he handled it then I suppose he did. These things happen.’ Hull striker Dame N'Doye (far left) shoots from inside the area to put the Tigers 1-0 up at home to Sunderland .

The goal-kicking forward played in 30 of the Vikings' 32 league and cup matches in 2014 and has been an ever-present so far this season but will sit out Thursday's trip to Salford and will not be back until after Easter. 'Danny has been carrying the injury for the last few weeks,' Widnes coach Denis Betts said. 'It's been affecting the way he's performed. Danny Tickle will be out for at least a month for Widnes Vikings after carrying groin injury for a few weeks . 'He's toughed it out but we need to look at him and do what's best for him.

'We're just being really smart with him. 'He got hit on the head in a game and had a bit of delayed concussion. His symptons have kept resurfacing when he's been putting the effort into training so, under medical advice, we've had to step him back and take our time with him. 'At the moment he's in some kind of sabbatical. He's sat at home waiting for his symptons to calm down. We're monitoring him almost daily. 'When he's ready to go, he'll have to go through six or seven days of training before he's allowed to be up for selection.

India's bowlers were hammered all over Australia between December and mid-February as the team lost their Test series 2-0 and failed to win a single match in the following Tri-series, which also featured England. However, fast bowlers Mohammed Shami, Umesh Yadav and Mohit Sharma have upped their game considerably at the World Cup and have combined with the strong spinners to forge a potent attack. India vice captain Virat Kohli is confident India can upset Australia to reach the World Cup final . The renowned batsman pushes through the nets during practice ahead of Thursday's semi-final . With the help of several run-outs, the Indian bowlers have dismissed the opposition in all seven matches on their way to the semi-finals. Kohli, the leading light in the much-vaunted Indian batting line-up, said everyone was aware of the areas where improvement was required and he was pleased by the way the pacemen had responded. India's bowlers including Mohit Sharma (centre) have picked up their game after early struggles Down Under . India's Mohammed Shami (right) celebrates after taking a wicket in the quarter final defeat of Bangladesh . 'The way the bowlers have reacted and the way they have performed with the composure and the confidence and the aggression all together, it's been wonderful to watch,' he told Cricket Australia's website. 'So we expect the bowlers to step up if you want to beat quality sides in the world and the way they have done this in this World Cup has been commendable. 'We've played the right kind of cricket and the difference now is how our bowling attack has come into play in this World Cup taking 70 wickets in seven games.

'That's probably been the difference, and if we continue to do that we have a great chance come game day.' India have not beaten Australia in any format since they arrived Down Under in late November but Kohli thinks Thursday at the Sydney Cricket Ground is the perfect opportunity to break that cycle. 'There couldn't be a better time for us,' he said. 'It's an opportunity for us to do justice to the way we've played so far in Australia, and we haven't had the results.'","India face Australia in the Cricket World Cup semi-finals on Thursday .

Liam Edwards, 29, walked into a Sainsbury's store in Salford, Greater Manchester, with the #BanHalal stickers and stuck them on numerous packets of meat in the chilled goods aisle. He was stopped by security and, after police were called, officers searched his home and found cannabis and a letter addressed from the Beer and Bacon Company of Great Britain which made reference to an 'anti-Jihadi frog'. Scroll down for video . Liam Edwards, 29 (pictured outside court, right), walked into a Sainsbury's store in Salford, Greater Manchester, and plastered the #BanHalal stickers on numerous packets of meat in the chilled goods aisle . The sticker which Edwards plastered on the supermarket chicken said: 'Halal is barbaric and funds terrorism.' However, he has insisted he is an animal rights activist and that the incident was not racially-aggravated . Manchester Magistrates' Court heard how there was also reference that he had browsed patriotsagainstIslam.co.uk on his home computer. Edwards, of Salford, admitted criminal damage in relation to the supermarket incident on February 18 and possession of cannabis. However, he denied that he was 'racially motivated' when he carried out the attack on the supermarket chicken and will face trial in July over the charge. It emerged that £16.50 worth of chicken had to be destroyed as a result of his actions. At the court hearing today, it was said that he was simply drawing attention to the 'inhumane' halal methods of animal slaughter, which involves slitting the animal's throat to allow the blood to drain out. Holly Holden, prosecuting, said: 'The defendant has gone to the supermarket and placed stickers on packets of chicken saying 'halal is barbaric and funds terrorism'. The chicken had to be destroyed because the stickers could not be removed. 'He says he wished to draw attention to the inhumane halal methods of animal slaughter and that was his motivation rather than racial prejudice. 'The point about animal cruelty could be expressed in a different way without the suggestion that halal and terrorism are linked.'

Mike Cahill, defending, said Edwards was protesting against halal slaughter and the reference to terrorism in the stickers referred neither to race nor religion. He said: 'He uses the word terrorism but that can't denote race or indeed religion.' Bailing him until a further hearing on July 23, District Judge James Hatton added: 'You have pleaded guilty to some matters but not guilty to the racially-aggravated criminal damage. There will have to be a trial.' Judge Hatton told Edwards that the conditions of his bail including not going near the Sainsbury's supermarket in Salford. Halal involves cutting through arteries in the neck . HALAL . Halal slaughtering involves cutting through the large arteries in the neck with one swipe of a blade, while a Muslim butcher recites a religious verse. All blood is then drained away since the consumption of blood is forbidden under Islamic law. Under Islamic law, an animal must be slaughtered by having its throat cut while it is conscious. NON-HALAL . In comparison, the non-halal method involves taking animals to an abattoir where they are stunned before being killed. It means the animal is unconscious when it is killed and has an instantaneous death, as opposed to enduring what animal rights activists claim is drawn-out pain and suffering. Once the animal has been killed at the abattoir, it is removed and taken to be hung and butchered.

But Panasonic is hoping to make protecting your home and family a lot easier, and more mobile. The manufacturer has announced the world’s first 4G surveillance camera called Nubo that detects and alerts homeowners to intruders and can be fitted inside and out the house. Home security: Built-in sensors detect human shapes and the camera will start recording automatically if a person is spotted. A message will then be sent via mobile (screenshot pictured) to alert a homeowner . Nubo was unveiled at Mobile World Congress in Barcelona. Built-in sensors detect human shapes and will start recording automatically if a person is spotted. The clips are uploaded to a free cloud service, and footage is taken at 720p with 10 frames per second to limit how much data the camera uses. When connected to a Wi-Fi network this increases to 30fps at 1080p. In addition to 4G, the Nubo works on 2G and 3G connections and because it is IP-66 weather resistant it can, in theory, be mounted anywhere with a mobile data signal. Mobile support including GPRS, 2G, 3G and 4G: Nubo will offer connectivity with leading wireless carriers, with the Vodafone being the first partner to launch with in Europe Outdoor ready . (IP-66): Nubo is IP-66 rated weather resistant and can be used indoors and outdoors . Smart human detection: Nubo’s advanced video analytics identify when a person walks in front of the camera and sends an alert to a mobile app . Links with smart home devices: Nubo’s wireless radio technology means it can communicate with external sensors, such as door or motion sensors. Battery power: Nubo can be connected to an external battery, allowing for temporary use in places without a power connection . Security: Videos, audio and images are automatically transferred to a cloud-based storage system, protected by bank-level SSL security and encrypted passwords . ‘In the past, consumers had to choose between a fixed Wi-Fi home monitoring product, a fixed professional surveillance or a mobile video recording product,’ a Panasonic spokesman told MailOnline. ‘To solve this problem, Panasonic Cameramanager is launching Nubo, a new standalone camera that allows users to have all the benefits of a mobile security camera, with the advantage of 4G connectivity.’ ‘Consumers have long had to compromise on mobility and connectivity when it came to their surveillance needs, bound either by location or connectivity,’ added Tijmen Vos, CTO of Panasonic Cameramanager. ‘Our vision is to deliver a product that allows users the freedom and flexibility of choosing where the camera can be used and the confidence in knowing that the data created is securely transmitted and stored. ‘With the introduction of Nubo, we’re putting the control of safety and surveillance into the user’s hands.’ When a recording begins, the owner is sent an alert via a smartphone app and can then use the Nubo’s two-way communication tool to talk to the person being filmed. Secret eye: The clips are uploaded to a free cloud service, and footage is taken at 720p with 10 frames per second to limit how much data the camera uses (camera pictured) Elsewhere, the camera has an infrared detectors and works in low lighting. During its press conference, Panasonic also announced it is launching its own mobile network using Vodafone’s infrastructure - making it a mobile virtual network operator (MVNO) - and service plans for the Nubo on this network will start at £5 ($7) a month. This includes cloud storage, but a microSD card slot will store footage if the mobile data fails. This means it can be used without a service plan, too. The cheapest plan will include 250 alarms per month and seven days of cloud storage for video clips. Additional plans will be available up to in a £33 ($50) a month for 2,500 alarms and 90 days of cloud storage. Once the data runs out alarms will still be sent but users will need to buy more to view the clips. Nubo's app will work with Android and iOS and users will be able to watch footage live, control how long Nubo records for and see a history log of activity. Nubo ships in November but can be pre-ordered in the UK and Netherlands from April. Panasonic said it plans to launch the camera in the US and other regions by March next year.","Nubo was unveiled at Mobile World Congress in Barcelona .

f9c3963bc803d207971782644c5ed3a6a32f7a0a,"Islamabad (CNN)Pakistan has ordered a stay of execution of a man who was convicted of manslaughter while he was 14 years old. Shafqat Hussain, 24, was scheduled to be hanged on Thursday, but a government official confirmed Wednesday night with a tweet that Hussain will not be hanged and that his case will be reviewed for another 72 hours. ""We are still unclear on what investigation can be done in 72 hours,"" said Shahab Siddiqui, Hussain's lawyer. ""We will be coordinating with the government and are happy to provide any documentation they would need."" Hussain's case has triggered outrage from human rights campaigners, who complain he did not get a fair trial and had confessed to murder after being severely tortured by the police. His family says Hussain, at the age of 14 was convicted of involuntary manslaughter for kidnapping and killing a child while he was employed as a security guard in 2004. Unable to afford legal counsel the state appointed him a defense lawyer, whom, according to human rights groups, failed to provide any evidence or claim that Hussain was a juvenile. This meant Hussain was tried as an adult in an anti-terrorism court. A social media campaign with the hashtag #SaveShafqat trended in Pakistan and a small protest was held in the capital to raise awareness about his case. Shafqat was calm when he thought he was going to be executed, Manzoor Hussain, his brother told CNN. ""He had said that if I don't get justice in this world, I will get it in my afterlife."" ""I can't tell you what kind of night my family has had. I close my eyes and I want to forget. I can't express the agony we have gone through, waiting and not knowing."" Hussain was initially due to be hanged on January 19, but under international pressure, Pakistan's Interior Minister Chaudhry Nisar called for a stay order. Addressing parliament, the minister called for an investigation into the young man's age. Two months later, another death warrant was issued for Hussain, with an execution date set for March 19. Since then Hussain's lawyers handed in a plea of clemency to the president's office with documentation that the inmate was a minor at the time of his arrest. Attention to his case comes in the wake of an announcement by Pakistan that it would lift its moratorium on the death penalty for all cases -- not just for those tried in anti-terrorism courts. Pakistan lifted the death penalty moratorium for terrorism cases following the attack on an Army Public School in Peshawar, which left at least 145 teachers and students dead. It was the deadliest act of terror in the country's history. The decision to lift the moratorium on all cases affects more than 8,000 prisoners currently on death row, the largest number in the world. The lifting of the moratorium has caused an uproar of criticism by human rights groups in Pakistan and abroad. ""It's like responding to a blood bath by indulging in blood lust themselves,"" Zohra Yusuf, the chairperson of the Human Rights Commission of Pakistan told CNN. ""Executions on this scale tend to brutalize society."" Earlier this week the European Union released a statement on its website calling Pakistan to ""reinstitute the moratorium and to respect fully all its international obligations, in particular the principle of fair trial."" The statement also said that Pakistan is a party to an international covenant ""that specifically prohibits the use of the death sentence for crimes committed by persons below eighteen years of age.""​ .","Pakistan postpones inmate's execution for the second time .

Dean Wilson, 37, accused his father of sleeping with his former partner and then warned: 'If I don't kill you now, I'll be back'. Norman Wilson initially laughed because his son's disturbing promise reminded him of Arnold Schwarzenegger's famous line from the film The Terminator. Now the 60-year-old, from Chesterfield, Derbyshire, is so terrified he is planning to move away, the court heard. Dean Wilson (left), 37, was jailed after running over his father Norman (right) with his Mazda because he was convinced he had slept with his ex-girlfriend, a court heard . Speaking from his home today, Mr Wilson said he is living in fear since his son went to jail. He said: 'I am traumatised by what happened. I need to move away. Everytime I look out of my front window onto where it happened I have a flashback.' 'I can remember feeling my ribs crack one by one as he reversed over me. 'Then he put one foot on the accelerator and one on the break to spin the wheel round to rip my skin off my legs. 'It was excruciating.' He added he has no clue where the idea that he had had an affair with Dean Wilson's ex-partner came from, insisting 'it never happened'. Norman, a retired recycling worker, said his son had three children with Elizabeth Marshall but that he only saw his grandchildren in passing in the street. 'He's not even with her anymore, I heard he was seeing someone else. Dean was accusing me of having an affair with her five years ago,' he added. The 60-year-old added he would never be rebuilding his relationship with his son, and felt he was constantly on the lookout for fear he would send someone to hurt him. 'I can't sleep at night or concentrate; I'm always looking over my shoulder. I don't know who his mates are. If my son says he'll be back, he'll be back. 'I've got to get away and move on with my life.' The defendant, who the court heard has a record of anxiety and depression, was arrested after going to Chesterfield Royal Hospital's mental health unit and admitting running over his father. Norman Wilson was treated for broken ribs, bruising (pictured) and grazes after he was run over by his son . He later told police he was certain his father had slept with his ex-girlfriend and that he drove over him twice because he was angry - but he denied trying to kill his father. Dean Wilson was charged with attempted murder, before the charge was dropped and changed to causing grievous bodily harm with intent, which he admitted in court. He was jailed for six years at Nottingham Crown Court on Monday. Prosecuting the case, Dawn Pritchard, said: 'The windscreen of Norman Wilson's Ford Focus had been smashed and he was out vacuuming the car when he heard a screech. 'He turned and saw his son saying he didn't want his kids or his ex-partner at his dad's house or he would kill him. 'Norman Wilson said the defendant indicated he had smashed the windscreen. 'The defendant said he had been told Norman had been going to bed with his ex and Dean Wilson said he was going to kill him and added, 'If I don't kill you now, I'll be back'.' Ms Pritchard added: 'The defendant then jumped in his car and came at speed and hit Norman Wilson so he was thrown in the air and as he landed a few yards from his own vehicle the defendant drove at him again and ran over his leg.' Witnesses said they saw the defendant drive the Mazda at his father before reversing over him. The 60-year-old (pictured today), who is now left using a mobility scooter, is terrified and planning to move . Norman Wilson initially laughed at his son's threat but now the 60-year-old, from Chesterfield, Derbyshire, is terrified after being run over outside his home (pictured) Natalie Mosley, who witnessed the incident, told the court that she put herself in the path of Dean Wilson's vehicle during another attempt to drive over him. Ms Pritchard explained how Norman Wilson remembers someone holding his head and saying he was dying when things became blurred. He was treated for broken ribs, bruising and grazes at Sheffield Northern General Hospital and is now left using a mobility scooter. In a victim impact statement, Mr Wilson said he feels threatened and that he has to leave the area. Matthew Donkin, defending, said: 'Dean Wilson behaved out of character and gave leave to all of his good senses. 'He has been the principle carer for his children aged seven and eight and his 14-year-old stepson. 'There was a lack of premeditation until he got in his vehicle. He immediately admitted what he had done and made full admissions.' Sentencing, Judge Michael Stokes said: 'Your relationship with your father broke down badly by your suspicions that rightly or wrongly he was involved sexually with your former partner. 'Travelling at a speed estimated at 20mph you drove at him and knocked him into the road and you then quite deliberately reversed over him. 'He was extremely lucky not to have sustained more serious injuries.' Dean Wilson was also handed a four year driving ban and told his car would be confiscated.

3fab252754add85a7d15bca628699e95545f0458,"Johnny Sexton must come through 'modified training' to prove his fitness for Ireland's pivotal RBS 6 Nations clash against Wales in Cardiff. Ireland's lynchpin fly-half has 'hit all his markers so far' in battling hamstring trouble, but is still fighting to recover to face Wales on Saturday, according to team manager Mick Kearney. Number eight Jamie Heaslip was due to take contact training on Monday for the first time since fracturing three vertebrae in his back against France on February 14. Ireland's Johnny Sexton is winning his battle to be fit to face Wales in the RBS 6 Nations on Saturday . The Leinster stalwart is now expected to be fit to face Wales, where victory would leave Ireland almost nailed-on for the Grand Slam. 'Johnny Sexton continues to improve following a mild hamstring strain,' said Kearney. 'As a precaution he will have modified training during the early part of the week with an expectation that he will train fully towards the end of the week. 'We are very happy where he is at, at the moment. He has hit all his markers so far. 'Johnny will have modified training in the early part of the week and if he comes through training through the latter part of the week, he will be available for selection. Sexton has come through all the tests asked of him so far but there is still a chance he could miss the game . 'Jamie Heaslip is expected to train fully this week and barring any setback will be available for selection. 'Sean O'Brien and Jared Payne have both progressed well through the return to play protocol and will be re-introduced to full training during the week. 'Johnny will have modified training today. Jamie will train fully today.' Team manager Kearney admitted British and Irish Lions Sexton and Heaslip are both 'extremely eager' to face Wales this weekend. Ireland are gunning to retain the Six Nations title for the first time since 1949, and also claim a second Grand Slam in six years. Sexton limped out of the latter stages of Ireland's 19-9 victory over England in Dublin on March 1 and has been battling to recover ever since. The 29-year-old has a history of hamstring problems, but Kearney does not expect that to colour his recovery. Jamie Heaslip is expected to train fully this week and barring any setback will be available for selection . 'From what I remember the last time he had a problem was between the Australia game and New Zealand game, in the November series just over 12 months ago,' said Kearney. 'He actually recovered pretty quickly then. 'He came off at half-time against Australia and was fit to play and played the whole game, or most of the game against New Zealand without any issue. 'That certainly wouldn't be a worry at the moment. 'Jamie (Heaslip) hasn't taken any contact yet. He will train fully today and provided there is no reaction he should be available for selection. 'They are extremely eager, absolutely: very eager to play.' Fit-again Ulster lock Dan Tuohy has been drafted back into Ireland's wider 36-man training squad . Fit-again Ulster lock Dan Tuohy was drafted back into Ireland's wider 36-man training squad for the final two weeks of Six Nations action. Ireland must win in Wales and Scotland to secure the Grand Slam and retain their Six Nations title - but, barring injury, will do so without veteran centre Gordon D'Arcy. The 35-year-old Leinster centre has been omitted from Schmidt's training squad, with Ulster's Darren Cave and Munster's Keith Earls providing midfield cover. Team manager Kearney refused to accept D'Arcy's absence could spark the end of his glittering 81-cap Test career however. His long-term centre sparring partner Brian O'Driscoll retired last summer, but D'Arcy himself has always been determined to push on to this year's World Cup. 'That is a selection issue, yes,' said Kearney of D'Arcy's absence. 'Gordon has been an unbelievable servant for Irish rugby. 'He's back fit, back playing for Leinster, so certainly I wouldn't rule him out for future consideration.' Both teams must give consent for Saturday's Millennium Stadium match to be played under a closed roof.

4e422ba17bc610d0c3bd0a89fdd78d7aea27ec85,"Stuart McCall's nearest and dearest knew what his reaction would be in the event of Rangers calling. Drop everything. Now 10 days into the job and confronted by his third and most difficult match, a barrage of advice from those friends and family has landed. Drop everyone. Two dismal draws against relegation candidates Livingston and Alloa, stretching the winless run to five matches, has damned the playing provision at Ibrox now operating under their third manager of a sorry season that McCall was hired to rescue. He has not been short of suggestions aimed at helping him carry out that brief picked up from Kenny McDowall. ‘I’ve got family and a lot of friends who are Rangers supporters and, if it was up to them, they wouldn’t have a team out there because everyone would be dropped,’ said McCall. ‘If you speak to supporters, they are so frustrated and disappointed. Stuart McCall has encountered a tricky start to his spell as Rangers manager . ‘You speak to one fan who wouldn’t have him in, and another who wouldn’t have him in, and so on. Kenny tried all different permutations up front with our five strikers. It’s the same with the backline and the midfield. ‘People have said it to me: “I wouldn’t have him, him or him in the team”. But that would leave us with about two players and I can’t flood the team with youngsters. My job is to get the best formula — a winning formula. We’ve got time to do it and it’s what I’m striving to do.’ The emergency work on a squad ravaged by a confidence slump is required for many reasons and some can be traced back to the recruitment — on bumper contracts — of several top-flight players who have failed to live up to being Rangers players even at a lower level. But McCall believes that a more recent explanation for the disarray in his inheritance, which includes four unfit Newcastle loan men, is that their direct competitors for promotion — and today’s opponents Hibernian — were able to be clever in January. Rangers, meanwhile, were chaotic. Hibs have won their past seven games in all competitions since deadline day, reached the Scottish Cup semi-final and are now unbeaten in 15 matches — a streak of results that stuttering Rangers have at no stage looked capable of stringing together. McCall joked that if his family and friends had their way that everybody would be dropped . McCall noted: ‘The key thing for them was the January transfer window when they managed to keep their best young player, Scott Allan, while we had to sell Lewis Macleod, who was ours. On top of that, they were able to add five players. ‘I remember saying to Alan Stubbs at the time what a great piece of business it was to bring in Keith Watson from Dundee United because he’s a really solid Premiership player. Fraser Fyvie, Tomas Cerny, Franck Dja Djedje and Martin Boyle have really strengthened their squad. ‘While they were doing that, Rangers brought in five players from Newcastle and only one of them has been able to play a part. Alan had a clean sweep of his playing staff last summer. It took them time to gel but right now they have energy and confidence and they are hungry as well. So this will be a big challenge for us.’ McCall dug into the reserve reaches of the squad to promote the impressive 18-year-old Tom Walsh. A dozen years his elder, Dean Shiels completed a game for only the second time this season. As McCall seeks that winning formula, he has a frustrated and often frustrating figure offering to be an intriguing ingredient today on a return to Easter Road. ‘I spoke to Dean before we picked him for the Alloa game,’ said McCall. ‘I don’ t know why he’s only had four starts this season. Obviously, there are reasons and Dean will be a big part of that. But he did well the other night for a rare 90 minutes. ‘Everyone is in the same boat — when you get an opportunity, you have to grab it. You’ve got to show that you want to be out there, in training and games. New boss McCall takes charge of a Rangers training session . ‘I know there are players here who want to be in my team. It’s OK being willing and wanting to do it. But there’s a big difference between that and actually producing. ‘Next season, Rangers need young, hungry players. Of course, you need to balance it with experience. But I’d like to have energy and vibrance in the team next season.’ Darren McGregor, having met the appearance stipulations on his contract, will be back for another season. He can bid to be as energetic and vibrant as McCall wishes but it is defensive fortitude that the boyhood Hibernian supporter will be determined to bring today to a Rangers team that have lost their past three to the capital club. The 29-year-old has filled in at right-back — rather than his favoured centre-half slot — too often this season but refuses to blame that adjustment for personal form that he admits has fallen below standard. ‘I’ve been disappointed with how I’ve played,’ conceded McGregor. ‘I need to take accountability as a defender. Rangers have limped to unconvincing draws against Livingston and Alloa under McCall . ‘We’ve conceded too many goals. I’ve played the majority of our games, so I need to say that I could have done better in certain aspects. ‘Everyone knows that I’m not a natural right-back. But I’d rather play in that position than be in the stand. ‘To be fair to the previous manager and this manager, their hands have been forced a bit of the time because of injuries. ‘But I can’t keep going over old ground. The nine games coming up are the most important of the season. I’m looking at this period as a sort of mini-league in itself. ‘It will be time for reflection, finger-pointing and talking about where it went wrong in the summer. But we have to be positive and think that, as long as we get up, in years to come that will be forgotten about. ‘I want my first season at Rangers to be capped with promotion. I don’t want it to be a failure, which it currently is. ‘To come back next season as a Premiership player would be special. We all know what the fans expect and the prestige of playing for this club. We’ve fallen short of that this year but, if we can get up, it will put some light on an otherwise dark season.’","Stuart McCall has endured a tricky start to spell as Rangers manager .

It comes after a FIFA taskforce recommended last month the tournament should be switched from summer to winter to avoid the searing heat of the Gulf in June and July, where temperatures can exceed 40C. The decision to hold the first ever winter World Cup was taken more than four years after the most controversial award of a sporting event in history. Scroll down for video . Shock: FIFA President Sepp Blatter awarded the 2022 World Cup to Qatar in December 2, 2010 . Iron fist: Sepp Blatter, speaking to journalists today, confirmed the final will be on December 18, 2022 . Confirming the date for the 2022 World Cup final, Walter De Gregorio, FIFA's director of communications, said: 'This is for us an important step. 'Finally we know the end of the tournament. It's a Sunday and, by the way, it's the national day in Qatar, so it fits perfectly.' He added: 'You have enough time to do your Christmas shopping.' FIFA has indicated the 2022 tournament will also be shortened to 28 days, instead of the usual 32. The competition is likely to begin (featuring the hosts' Qatar) on November 21. The decision means the traditional and popular Boxing Day club matches will take place as usual – which will come as some comfort to the Premier League who have strongly opposed the switch. UEFA - the body that governs European football - had pushed for the final to be as late as December 23. Main stage: The Al-Rayyan stadium, in an artist impression, will hold the  Qatar 2022 World Cup final . The Qatar World Cup has been mired in controversy ever since the shock decision to stage the tournament in the desert kingdom which has no footballing history and a questionable human rights record. Sepp Blatter, FIFA's long-standing president, even admitted last year that staging the tournament in Qatar was a 'mistake' – justifying it by saying 'but one makes lots of mistakes in life'. Allegations of widespread corruption and collusion dogged the process from the outset. A report by investigator Michael Garcia into allegations of corruption remains secret, unpublished and subject to dispute between its author and FIFA. The idea of holding the prestigious tournament in winter has also proved controversial. When the decision to hold the competition in Qatar was first made, Blatter vowed: 'The basic conditions – not just for Qatar but for all the candidates – were the same. It means the FIFA World Cup is played in June and July.' But following major concerns about the scorching weather in the country, he made a U-turn saying it was 'not responsible' to play in the burning sun. Controversial: The FIFA president initially said the tournament would be in the summer, but backtracked . A report by investigator Michael Garcia into allegations of corruption remains secret and unpublished . This enraged the Premier League and other European leagues as it will cause huge upheaval to the football calendar. After learning of the decision of the FIFA taskforce last month, Premier league chief executive Richard Scudamore said: 'I'm very disappointed, that's the word, on behalf of all the European leagues and particularly the European clubs who provide most of the players for this World Cup'. Then there has been the worldwide condemnation of the treatment of workers hired to build the infrastructure (the Qatar World Cup is set to cost an estimated £138billion – about 60 times more than the South Africa World Cup in 2010). Human rights groups have accused Qatar of failing to deal with the abuse of migrants, with almost 200 workers dying in the country and a significant number believed to have sustained injuries due to unsafe working practices. Campaigners also revealed how workers toiled for long hours for pitiful wages in unsafe and insanitary conditions. May 2022 European seasons (2021-22) end as usual . July Champions League qualifiers.

c82875ce6593eda984ac8ada56e9553b0885aa35,"Arsenal manager Arsene Wenger has made the stunning claim that his side would be better off in the Europa League next season, after repeatedly failing to make an impact in the Champions League. Tuesday night's 2-0 win in Monaco was not enough to prevent a last-16 exit as Arsenal lost out on away goals rule following their 3-1 first-leg defeat at the Emirates last month. And Wenger, who has been in the competition for 17 straight seasons, says that his side might even be better away from the top-tier competition in future given their recent trend of exiting almost as soon as the knockout stages have begun. Arsene Wenger had admitted that Arsenal might have a better chance of winning in the Europa League . Wenger's Arsenal side could only find two goals in Monaco on Tuesday, when they needed at least three . After repeated Champions League failure, Wenger has speculated about winning the Europa League in future . The third-placed team in each Champions League group - a fate that Wenger has never suffered - move into the Europa League rather than a total exit from Europe, and the Arsenal boss believes that might be a better silverware opportunity. When asked if these early exits were eating away at him, Wenger replied: 'Yes, but we were eliminated by teams who reached the final. Maybe it would be better not to pass the group phase and play the Europa League than to be eliminated in the last 16. We would have more chances to win a title.' When pressed for clarification, the Arsenal manager insisted this was meant to be a comment about the abrupt and unforgiving nature of the Champions League in its sudden-death phase rather than a serious realignment of ambitions.

Aaron Ramsey added a second goal for the Gunners but they could not find a third to send them through .

Wenger has never won a European trophy but perhaps the Europa League would offer a better opportunity . The Arsenal boss also told L'Equipe that he thought his team's performance was good but that they left themselves too much to do after a poor showing in London last month. 'The performance was good, it was a difficult task,' Wenger said. 'They surprised us in the first game because subconsciously we were too sure of ourselves.

8730489ba50e2a598a21a633c9907ae1b5075f75,"A group of Avant-garde light designers in Melbourne are about to take an apartment tower and transform it into a beautiful canvas that can tell you more about the weather than looking up at the sky. Thirty-five 'fins' run up and down the 40-story structure that hold 250,000 diffused LED's. Bruce Ramus, creative director of the project, said every half hour the building will communicate the next day's weather forecast, while during the remaining time it will be like a 'light house' communicating the 'feel' of the weather through light. Scroll down for video . The building will communicate the next day's weather forecast as well as reflecting the current 'feel' of the weather . 250,000 LED bulbs are responsible for the flickering lights that can be programmed to look like rain or wind . 'Essentially, if the weather changes, so will the lights,' he told Daily Mail Australia. After spending eight years living in Melbourne Mr Ramus said he noticed Melburnians had a peculiar obsession with the weather and thought it could be possible to 'bring light to a community' in a way that articulates what it actually feels like to be there. During the day it will appear to be a normal building but as the sun goes down and the city is plunged into darkness, you will really see the effects of the lights. 'There's a lot of movement available to this lighting system so if it ever gets windy down in the Docklands, the lights will move directionally with the wind. Every half hour, tomorrows weather forecast will wrap around the building . 'The movement isnt physical but the way we can program the lights means there will be a sense of gentle but apparent movement,' he said. He explained that by experimenting with the lights programming he can take a cool blue and introduce a shadow that can make it appear as if the building is moving, as rain would. The light show will be based off weather data sent through by the Bureau of Meteorology. Don't expect the building to look like the weather forecast app on your phone though as Mr Ramus wants the building to echo more than the temperature. 'It's not necessarily about what the light does but how it makes you feel.' 'We really want to explore how a cool change feels, or the breaking sun feels,' he added. Visionary: Mr Ramus wants architecture to reflect nature and humanity instead of the static concrete jungle we see today . Mr Ramus said light is a language everyone can understand because we don't understand it through our brains, but instead feel and understand it through our bodies. 'When you see a blue light, you might not be able to describe it but you get how it feels. Light is a language we don't have to think about,' he added. Mr Ramus said he wanted to bring a feeling of movement that's engaging so buildings can start to relate to people and reflect humanity. 'You get it out there in nature all the time. There are subtle movements in trees or the ocean. Then when we go to cities, it is just static chunks of concrete and glass. I would prefer they reflect us and the natural elements we are from.' The Lend Lease building is expected to be completed in early 2017 however Mr Ramus said, if all goes to plan, the lights should be up and running next year.","A Melbourne building will light up to reflect the current weather .

Lance Corporal Joseph Scott Pemberton is accused of killing Jennifer Laude, whose body was discovered in a motel room in Olongapo City on October 11. The deal would have seen him admit to the killing in exchange for having the charge downgraded from murder to homicide, which comes with a maximum prison sentence of 20 years instead of 40. But the family angrily rejected Pemberton's plea bargain offer at the start of his trial today, which is proceeding as the marine has pleaded not guilty to murder. Scroll down for video . Lance Corporal Joseph Scott Pemberton arrives at court today for the first day of his trial. He is accused of murdering Filipino transgender woman Jennifer Laude in Olongapo City on October 11 . It is claimed US Marine Pemberton (left) murdered Ms Laude (right) after finding out she had been born a man . Flanked by officers Pemberton (centre) heads to court. His $500,000 plea bargain has been rejected . Laude's relatives said they had received a letter from the US Marine, who was 19 at the time of the killing, offering 21 million pesos ($468,000) in exchange for their approval to lower the charge . Prosecutor Emilie Fe de los Santos told reporters that Pemberton's lawyers had made an offer to settle the case, but no agreement was reached by today so the trial began as planned. De los Santos gave no details about the plea bargain offer. But Laude's relatives said they had received a letter from the US Marine, who was 19 at the time of the killing, offering 21 million pesos ($468,000) in exchange for their approval to lower the charge from murder to homicide. 'No amount of money could pay for the years I spent raising my child,' Ms Laude's mother Julita Cabillan told reporters. 'What they did to my child was gruesome. Just because we are poor doesn't mean we can't fight for justice.' Wearing a black suit, grew shirt and silver and green patterned tie, Pemberton was photographed being escorted by US soldiers to the hearing in Olongapo. Laude, also known as Jeffrey, was found naked with strangle marks on her neck having been drowned in the toilet bowl of a cheap motel room in the city's red light district in October last year, according to a police autopsy report. In rejecting the plea bargain offer made by Pemberton (right) the victim's mother Julita Cabillan said: 'No amount of money could pay for the years I spent raising my child' Pemberton, who had just finished training exercises between US and Philippine marines near Olongapo, checked into the motel with Ms Laude, aged 26, shortly after meeting her at a bar, prosecutors said. The prosecution's first witness, a bellboy, testified today that he saw Pemberton at the motel on the night Ms Laude was killed. However the proceedings were closed to the media, and scant details were only initially available via de los Santos. She said that, although Laude's family rejected the plea bargain offer, it could be revived and introduced 'anytime' during the trial. But lawyers for Ms Laude's family accused de los Santos of promoting the plea bargain, and separately filed a request with the justice department on Monday asking for her to be replaced. Ms Laude's death re-ignited long-simmering anti-US sentiment in the Philippines, a former American colony that still allows a significant American military presence via joint training exercises. Judge Roline Ginez-Jabalde is overseeing the trial, though both sides spent the past two weeks discussing the possible plea bargain. Pemberton is seen in a mobile phone picture taken inside the courtroom by the victim's sister Marilou Laude at his first hearing in December. She said she 'wanted to bang his head against the wall' Protesters chanting 'Justice for Laude' demonstrate outside the courtroom where Pemberton first appeared . Protesters jeer as the convoy of vehicles transporting Pemberton leaves the court after his first appearance . The Philippine Star reported that Julita Laude had been considering the $500,000 offer from Pemberton to downgrade the charges from murder to homicide. 'There have been talks on plea bargaining. It is possible for an accused to plead guilty to a lower offense, in this case from murder to homicide. 'The difference here lies in the number of years,' lawyer Virgie Suarez, one of two private lawyers for the Laude family, told the paper. She added: 'Indeed the Laude family wants nothing else but to see Pemberton being immediately convicted and his sentence be imposed. 'If this will happen it will do well if Pemberton will publicly apologize to the Laudes and to the Filipino people.' Lawyer Harry Roque, the other private counsel of the Laude family, earlier told members of media that their position is non-negotiable. Both lawyers have also expressed their belief that they have 'overwhelming' evidence and any judge handling the case will find the accused guilty. Pemberton, who was on shore leave after participating in the joint US-Philippine Balikatan military exercises, met Laude at the Ambyanz Nightlife Bar located along Magsaysay Avenue on October 11 and the two later checked in at the nearby Celzone Lodge. Pemberton (left) has pleaded not guilty to murder. Guards transport him to a military detention facility (right) Laude was later found dead by motel staff. Laude's sister, Marilou, had mixed emotions on seeing Pemberton for the first time at an earlier hearing in December. 'I wanted to ask him why he killed my brother,' said Marilou, whose transgender sibling was born Jeffrey eventually became Jennifer. 'I wanted to bang his head against the wall. I wanted to be angry, but I am also afraid.' Pemberton is temporarily detained at the Mutual Defense Board facility inside Camp Aguinaldo in Quezon City while remaining under US custody.

Chris Farrell was thrown out of the taxi on November 22 after calling the driver a p****, Wirral Magistrates Court heard today. The 31-year-old who appeared on the sixth series of the TV show in 2010 was on his way home with his partner after drinking a bottle of wine and a few beers. Apprentice: Former Apprentice star Chris Farrell (pictured in 2010) has pleaded guilty to punching a taxi driver while drunk - but claimed the 'unpleasant' man was aggressive towards him and his partner . Altercation: The 31-year-old ex-Royal Marine (circled) - who featured on the sixth series of the hit TV show - was thrown out of the taxi after calling the driver a 'p****' The taxi driver said he had been assaulted by a male and female according to prosecutor Alan Currums. He said: 'As he [taxi driver] approached the female he says he was punched in the face by the defendant. 'He said he was called 'a p****'. The taxi driver stopped the vehicle on the hard shoulder to call police.' 'The defendant had drunk a bottle of wine and a few beers but wouldn't say he was intoxicated. He said he was angry and upset with the driver.' Chair of the bench Eileen Ashton fined him £400 to be paid within 28 days. He was also ordered to pay £150 compensation to the taxi driver and a court fee of £125. The man who served in the Royal Marines for 10 years before becoming a businessman has previous convictions of drink driving, fraud and 'carrying an offensive weapon'. In February 2009, he pleaded guilty to possessing an extendable baton and knuckle-duster which was found in his Merceds car. Police were called to his home following allegations he hit ex-wife Clair and wounded her - drawing blood. TV star: Farrell appeared on the sixth series of the Apprentice and was fired by Sir Alan Sugar (centre) in week eight . And after completing filming for The Apprentice in 2010, he was reportedly hiding in Spain after his former boss revealed she had fired him due to claims of fraud. He was working on commission basis for Mortgages4Plymouth when Tricia Kennedy axed him. During his appearance in The Apprentice, Farrell said he was a sniper and he took 'that killer instinct across into business'. Gerry Pachter who was defending Farrell said: 'Mr Farrell regrets his behaviour that night. He is very remorseful but felt the taxi driver had been particularly unpleasant. 'He had been drinking during the course of the evening. Mr Farrell thought the taxi driver had been aggressive towards him and his partner. 'He recognises that he should've turned a blind eye. The taxi driver pulled up and kicked them out of the taxi - this is what got to them. It was dark and in an unsafe area.' He added: 'The taxi driver wasn't badly injured and there was no hospitalisation.' Mr Pachter said Mr Farrell works in a 'very important high profile unit' as a business manager at Port2Port Maritime Security in Salford. Port2Port provides ships with armed security to fight pirates, using ex-Royal Marines and Army commandos. Mr Pachter requested Mr Farrell be given a fine instead of a community order because it would be 'very difficult' for him due to his work commitments.","Chris Farrell was fired in eighth week of The Apprentice show aired in 2010 .

Stevenson, who is not a Christian, was wary of taking on the role but said it had been a 'wonderful challenge' Stevenson told The Observer: 'I was filming in her iconic white sari with the blue stripes. 'People would come up to me, drop and touch my hem...in India, she's still revered. She lifted tens of thousands of people off the streets and into her care.' Stevenson, who starred in films such as Truly, Madly, Deeply, The Politician's Wife and Accused, is heading the cast of the forthcoming feature film about Mother Teresa, The Letters. The biopic explores the life of the saint through letters she wrote to her longtime friend and spiritual advisor, Father Celeste van Exem over a nearly 50-year period. The letters, published in 2007, revealed her crisis of faith and the torment of feeling Jesus had abandoned her. Mother Teresa, who died in 1997 aged 87, became one of the 20th century's most influential religious figures. She founded an international order - the Missionaries of Charity - in the slums of Calcutta dedicated to the poor, disabled and dying. She won the Noble Peace Prize in 1979 for her role in founding the order and by the time of her death, it had grown to more than 4,000 sisters running orphanages, hospices and charity centres in 133 countries. The film partly draws on Mother Teresa's secret letters, published in 2007 revealing her crisis of faith . The biopic will be released this year in the hope it coincides with Mother Teresa's canonisation . Stevenson, who is not religious, was initially wary of taking on the role but said it had been a 'wonderful challenge'. To perfect the role, Stevenson watched and listened 'endlessly' to historic recordings of Mother Teresa. She told The Observer: 'It was very daunting, because I'm so wrong for her. I'm 5ft 8in, quite strongly built. I'm not in any way miniature (Mother Teresa was only 5ft). 'I don't have a religious faith and she believed so ardently in God. I also couldn't differ from her more when it comes to her views on women's rights, birth control and abortion...but it was a wonderful challenge.' There was an early screening  of The Letters at the Vatican, at the International Catholic film festival last year. Its cast also includes 85-year-old Swedish actor Max von Sydow and Rutger Hauer, who won a Golden Globe award for Best Supporting Actor in Escape from Sobibor. It is directed by William Riead who was inspired by Richard Attenborough's Oscar-winning film Gandhi. The biopic will be released this year in the hope it coincides with Mother Teresa's canonisation.","As actress passed through slums in costume, locals dropped to the ground .

The 27-year-old, arrested on suspicion of having sex with a 15-year-old girl, has been suspended by the Premier League strugglers pending the outcome of a police investigation. However, the Black Cats are sending a fitness coach to Johnson’s two-acre woodland pad to oversee private workouts. Adam Johnson, pictured with girlfriend Stacey Flounders,has had his bail extended until April 23 . The 27-year-old Sunderland winger was arrested on suspicion of having sex with a 15-year-old girl . The player is understood to have told Sunderland, who appointed Dick Advocaat as new manager on Tuesday following the dismissal of Gus Poyet, that he is innocent. And while publicly club officials moved to suspend him, privately they want to keep him fit in the event that he is cleared in time to join their fight against relegation. A source said: ‘There’s a fitness coach going pretty much every day. The idea is to keep him ready so that if the allegations are dropped he can go straight back into the side.’ The gates at Johnson's £1.85million were shut following his arrest earlier this month . Former Manchester City man Johnson has been suspended by Sunderland since his arrest . Johnson was arrested on March 2.

Jennifer Karren, 35, passed away in hospital after the whale collided with her boat in the Sea of Cortez off Cabo San Lucas on Wednesday. Two other people aboard the boat were also injured. The group had been returning from a snorkeling trip with 'Cabo Adventures' at around 11am when the whale hit the small vessel, tossing Karren into the water. The captain and a tourist both jumped into the water and pulled her back to the boat. Photographs released by the Federal Attorney for Environmental Protection on Thursday show people on the boat desperately trying to save the woman with CPR. Scroll down for video . Freak accident: An image shows a woman receiving CPR aboard a small boat after she was injured by a breaching grey whale near the beach resort of Cabo San Lucas, Mexico. The woman later died in hospital . Jennifer Karren (pictured with her husband Trevor Karren) had been returning from a snorkeling trip with 'Cabo Adventures' at around 11am when the whale hit the small vessel, tossing her into the water . Terrifying: The boat, pictured, collided with a grey whale, fatally injuring the woman and hurting two others . The boat company reported that the CPR was administered by another passenger, a nurse. Mexican navy personnel responded to the scene and moved Karren, from Calgary, to shore and from there she was rushed to a nearby private hospital where she later died. The two other people were said to have received 'considerable' injuries but are expected to survive, the company said. In a statement, tour operator Cabo Adventures explained that the boat's captain, José Salazar Tendis, had to make a 'sudden maneuver' to try to avoid the whale directly in front of them, but the beast hit the side of the boat instead. The captain immediately called the Naval Rescue, it said. The boat was carrying nine tourists on a snorkel tour at the time, the company said. Unknown danger: A California gray whale is pictured breaching in Magdalena Bay, Baja California Sur, Mexico (file photo). They can reach 49ft in length and weigh 36 tonnes and are often seen in Mexican waters . CBC News reported that Canadian consular officials in the area were assisting the woman's family. A spokesman for the Department of Foreign Affairs said: 'Our thoughts are with the family and friends of a Canadian citizen who passed away in Mexico.' Gray whales can reach 49ft in length and weigh 36 tonnes and are known to frequent Mexican waters, where they migrate annually between their feeding and breeding grounds. Ahead of accident, Mexican authorities announced on Wednesday that the gray whale population in the area is unusually large this season, which runs from December to April. Cabo Adventures runs multiple tour days, from snorkeling and scuba diving to whale watching and camel riding. Carren was on the $79 'Snorkel & Sea Adventure' which takes groups to 'secluded coves and isolated beaches for the ultimate snorkel excursion', according to the company's website.","Jennifer Karren, 35, was killed while vacationing in Cabo San Lucas, Mexico on Wednesday .

d0db7ef113649b5c6d3b97d4f7e3fde2fe65db5b,"The US Presbyterian Church  has voted to expand its definition of marriage to include gay and lesbian couples after a decades long debate. The church, which accounts for just under two million members and represents the largest Presbyterian denomination, made the announcement after the majority of its 171 regional governing bodies approved the change. Its revised constitution will now read that marriage is 'a unique commitment between two people, traditionally a man and a woman,' as opposed to just a man and woman previously. Scroll down for video . The Presbyterian Church USA which accounts for just under two million members, voted to expand its definition of marriage to include gay and lesbian couples ©Alex Wong (Getty Images/AFP/File) 'Finally, the church in its constitutional documents fully recognizes that the love of gays and lesbian couples is worth celebrating in the faith community,' Rev. Brian D. Ellison, executive director of the Covenant Network of Presbyterians, which advocates gay inclusion in the church, told the New York Times. 'There is still disagreement, and I don’t mean to minimize that, but I think we are learning that we can disagree and still be church together.' The new language, which was approved by the church's General Assembly last year, had  to be ratified by more than half its regional bodies. A grouping of congregations in the state of New Jersey became the 86th body to do just that Tuesday. The decision is likely to drive a further wedge between Presbyterian USA members, who have taken opposite sides on the issue. The church has in fact been losing some of its members as it adopts a more liberal stance on social and religious issues. That being said, the fact that some many members who were against same-sex marriage have moved on to other churches made the passage of this new definition far easier for the church. At last year's Presbyterian General Assembly, the church also gave its pastors a green light to marry gay and lesbian couples in states where such marriages are allowed. 'These decisions have been welcomed by some and are a disappointment to others,' Gradye Parsons, stated clerk of the General Assembly, said at the time. The Presbyterians' position stands in sharp contrast to that of the Roman Catholic church, the biggest single denomination among Americans, and fundamentalist Evangelicals who strongly oppose gay marriage. In 2011, the Presbyterian Church USA voted to approve the ordination of openly gay and lesbian clergy. The constitution's new wording will take effect on June 21.","After a debate that has lasted three decades, the US Presbyterian Church has voted to define marriage to include gay and lesbian couples .

The 16-year-old was surfing at Palm Beach at the Gold Coast in Queensland with friends at about 6.30am when he was thrown off his board and found himself tugging up a person's body as he surfaced. 'A 16-year-old boy was surfing with friends, he caught a wave and as he's come up and he's touched something which felt like hair,' A spokesperson for Queensland police told Daily Mail Australia. The 16-year-old surfer told police he had fallen off his board and upon resurfacing, felt something in the water that felt like hair. Upon tugging up the object out of the water, he said he realised it was a man's body . 'He then grabbed at the item and when he pulled up the item he saw the face of someone at which point he panicked, let go of the body and returned to shore. 'He later returned to the water with a friend to try and find the body but they couldn't locate it and contacted police around 8.30 this morning.' Gold Coast Water Police Senior Sergeant Gavin Peachey told the Brisbane Times: 'That's what he [the surfer] believes - there's nothing to confirm that at the moment.' Police immediately launched a search of the area using boats, jet skis and a helicopter; however they have received no reports of a missing person in the area. Abandoned items of clothing were found on the beach, including a Maktec by Makita hat and a white Volcan t-shirt, however they have since been claimed by a member of the public and have been deemed unrelated to the incident.

22d8123dee5121638609edee86d68058eb2eb4ff,"At first glance The Fliers and Explorers Globe appears to be an ordinary antique, hidden in a small over-looked office in downtown Brooklyn, at the end of a nondescript hallway. On closer inspection, however, you will discover it is actually one of the world's most fascinating relics, celebrating the giddy heights of exploration and adventure. What makes the artefact precious is not its beauty or age, but for the inclusion of the inked signatures and routes of nearly every single famous explorer and aviator in modern history, from Sir Edmund Hillary, to Neil Armstong and Amelia Earhart. The American Geographical Society's Fliers and Explorers Globe: The signature of Amelia Earhart, the first female aviator to fly solo across the Atlantic Ocean, is prominently featured . The society acquired the 18-inch globe in 1929 as a gift from AGS president John H. Finley. He invited early heroes of exploration and aviation to draw their routes and sign their names . Hillary was immortalised on the spherical relic, along with more recently, Ann Bancroft, who was the first woman to successfully finish a number of arduous expeditions to the Arctic and Antarctic . This 18-inch globe is hidden beneath a dark cloth in the headquarters of the American Geographical Society, the oldest established national geographical organisation in the US. The valuable tradition of the globe signing started in 1929, when the society president, and editor-in-chief of the New York Times, John H. Finley would personally go down to the Lower Manhattan docks to welcome returning adventurers. Explorers would ink their routes and names on the prized object, documenting their piece of history in the moment it happened. Among those commemorated is Amelia Earhart who set records becoming the first woman to fly across the Atlantic Ocean in 1928, and was the first individual to fly over both the Atlantic and Pacific. Tragically the aviation pioneer mysteriously disappeared in 1937 as she was trying to circumnavigate the globe from the equator, and was legally declared dead in 1939. On May 20, 1927, pilot Charles Lindbergh embarked on the world's first solo non-stop flight from New York to Paris. Enduring a 33.5-hour crossing, the 25-year-old was victorious and received international stardom, and his route was marked onto the globe to document the achievement. Sadly tragedy stuck in 1932 when his 20-month-old son was kidnapped and tragically murdered in what was called, 'the Crime of the Century.' In the society's own words, the globe is 'a priceless and unique symbol of humanity's unquenchable drive to explore the universe.' A crowning glory of the AGS institution, the globe would not have always seemed as out of place. The society was created in 1851 following Sir John Franklin's disappearance on his Arctic mission. A group of like-minded explorers banded together to create a rescue mission, and thus, the AGS was born. New Zealand explorer, Sir Edmund Hillary, became the first climber to reach the summit of Mount Everest, (left), and Charles Lindberg who made the first solo transatlantic airplane flight in 1927, (right).

Despite the mission being unsuccessful the AGS grew in popularity, with scholars, businessmen and government officials joining the ranks, at its then office, a celebrated neo-classical building in Washington Heights, to discuss latest geographic news. Unlike rivals, National Geographic Society, who focused on photography and popular geography, the New York based society placed its efforts on sponsoring expeditions, geographic research and education. The society was the principal map resource for the United States for decades, and at its peak had a permanent staff force of over 80, contractually making maps for the government. Government revenues died down after the war, and with the AGS losing a lot of donations, the headquarters were sold in 1970.

It is strange that the globe, arguably the most fascinating in the world, is hidden away with nobody to witness the journey of Wiley Post, who in 1933 was the first to fly around the world, or Robert Peary, the first man to the North and South Pole. Current executive director, John Konarski III, said: 'It sits in my office and no one sees it. I'd like to get it into the public.' The society is facing a revival, with plans to relocate back to Manhattan, to the redeveloping South Street Seaport neighborhood, poignantly close to where the Finley would first ask explorers to leave their ink mark on history.

Rancic later issued an on-air apology to the 18-year-old after social media jumped to the teen's defense. But her apology was not enough for co-host Kelly Osbourne, who criticized her remarks and quit a few days later. Rancic and fellow co-host Brad Goreski  will return in September, along with executive producer Melissa Rivers.","Fashion commentary show will be on hiatus until September .

The news was released through a 16 minute video, in which dozens of Taliban fighters are shown being driven into the fortified base. The white flag of the Taliban is also shown being unfurled by one of the militants whilst another scene shows one of the group's leaders making a lengthy speech in Pashto. The white flags of the Taliban can be seen being unfurled over the buildings as the fighters swarm into the former US military base. A senior Taliban leader is shown making a speech, declaring that the military base had been liberated by the Taliban. The video shows footage of  well-built fortitications of the former US base, once used to tackle the local trade in heroin in Farah province. The Taliban's exaggerated report ignores the fact that the base had not been used by NATO forces for over a year. American troops have not been operating from Bakwa base since March 2013. Multiple convoys of white estate cars are shown being driven into the compound, parking inside the fort walls. Fighters dressed in traditional Afghan dress and armed with machine guns can be seen getting out of the cars and gathering outside Bakwa district's headquarters building. Multiple convoys of white estate cars are shown being driven into the compound, parking inside the fort walls. The low quality footage was recently released in Pashto by al-Emarah media, the Taliban's official multimedia branch.

Growing fears remain that the Taliban are developing Farah province into their new hub for launching greater attacks on cities like Kabul.

e191ab92ec26ac23740f5613c85f979c62e1d622,"A devoted husband who complained about his dying wife's care was mistakenly investigated for attempted murder after an NHS call-handler misunderstood his comments. John Histon called the health service after allegedly being told by a paramedic that call-outs to his wife Betty were 'becoming costly'. Mr Histon said he told the 111 operator: 'I suppose it is best to get her to suffocate and she won't be a problem to you.' The 70-year-old was then horrified when police turned up on his door 24 hours later saying ambulance trust staff reported he was threatening to kill his wife. A paramedic is said to have moaned that call-outs to terminally ill Betty Histon were 'becoming costly'. When her husband complained to the NHS he was investigated for attempted murder over comments he made . After searching his home in Bristol and finding Mrs Histon - who had chronic lung conditions - asleep in bed, they dropped the investigation and the NHS has since apologised. Mr Histon, who has since lost his wife to long-standing lung problems, said his and her treatment in her final days was 'shocking'. The retired decorator from  Bristol said: 'When they turned up on the door they asked me ""do you know why we are here?"", I assumed there had been a break-in in the area. 'They said they had an allegation that I have tried to smother my wife - I thought it was a hoax. I was shocked and nearly hit the floor. 'I never deserted her and cared for her right to the very end so it was very distressing to be accused and I was very angry.' Former auxiliary nurse Mrs Histon had a lung condition and her concerned husband called for paramedics on December 15 when she was struggling to breathe. He claims the paramedics who attended said the call-outs to the grandmother were 'becoming a costly exercise'. Mr Histon said: 'The young female paramedic said ""what do you expect, there is no point in admitting her to hospital, there is nothing we can do for her"". 'She was quite cocky about it and she said looking at the notes it looks like they had been called out quite frequently and it was becoming ""a costly exercise"".' Mr Histon called the NHS 111 service - who work with the ambulance service - the next day to lodge a complaint. An ambulance was called to Mrs Histon's suburban street (pictured) in Bristol by her husband. Police arrived the following day after an NHS call handler misunderstood comments he made over the phone . 'I said to the operator I suppose it is best to get her to suffocate and she won't be a problem to you again to try and emphasise how upsetting it was to be told we were some kind of burden to them,' he said. 'I thought nothing of it until the next evening I got a knock on the door from the police. 'They said they had received an allegation I had tried to smother my wife. They said it was from the ambulance.' Mrs Histon died in January from bronchopneumonia and Mr Histon is considering legal action against South Western Ambulance Service NHS Foundation Trust over his and his wife's treatment. A spokesman for the trust said: 'Mr Histon raised concerns regarding advice he had been given by one of the ambulance crews who attended his wife. 'He also had concerns about a safeguarding referral made following Mr Histon's comments about it being 'best to get her to suffocate'. 'The Trust has given Mr Histon sincere condolences following the loss of his wife, and is sorry that he took offence from the advice given to him by the ambulance service. 'The Trust has also confirmed that the safeguarding referral to the police could have been managed differently, however, due to the number of vulnerable people the trust comes into contact with, staff are always very sensitive to such comments. 'Mr Histon has confirmed that he will be pursuing some form of financial compensation and although he has received a full response from the Trust regarding his complaint, should he feel there are any elements he still requires further clarification on we would urge him to get in touch.'

47aa79ce8e462d1e303c8cafb0750a0885e1b41f,"A seven-year-old boy suffered a deep wound above his eye after he was mauled by a Staffordshire Bull Terrier cross he was trying to cuddle. McKinley Worthington was bitten by the dog during a family day out at a pub near his home in Bolton, Greater Manchester last April. CCTV footage shown to Bolton Magistrates' Court shows the schoolboy being licked by the landlady's dog before it turns and bites him as he leans in for a cuddle. Mauled: McKinley Worthington, right with his father, Aaron, was bitten by the dog during a family day out at a pub near his home in Bolton, Greater Manchester last April. Left, the boy was left with a wound above his eye . Family day out: McKinley was with his sister, Maisie and parents Sammi-Jo and Aaron, pictured together . The dog's owner, Margaret Wilson, who runs the Oddfellows Arms in Bolton, Greater Manchester was convicted of having a dog dangerously out of control last week. She was fined £200 and ordered to pay £520 in costs, but her dog, named Caine, will not be destroyed. Instead it must wear a muzzle in public places and in the pub area at all times. McKinley's mother, Sammi-Jo Gledhill, said after the hearing that her son started screaming 'I am going to die' as blood poured from the wound above his eye. He was taken to hospital where he was given eight stitches - leaving him with a scar above his eye. McKinley is now petrified of dogs and tells his mother he looks 'ugly' because of the scarring. He also refuses to leave the house without his cap on. McKinley and his three-year-old sister, Maisie, had been taken to the pub with their mother and father, where the dog, a Rhodesian Ridgeback cross, was allowed to walk around freely. Margaret Wilson, pictured last week outside court, was convicted of having a dog dangerously out of control. Right, a Staffordshire Bull Terrier-Rhodesian Ridgeback crossbreed like the one that attacked McKinley . Footage taken from a security camera shows McKinley on his knees trying to get the dog to play with him at around 7pm - seven hours after the family arrived at the pub. Initially the dog is seen licking McKinley's face, but then bites the schoolboy when he leaned in for a cuddle. Witness Trevor Oliphant said: 'When the little lad came in the dog went to his bed. The wee lad went to follow him and I said ""I think he is tired"". It appeared the dog didn't want to play with him.' Wilson denied wrongdoing claiming the boy's injuries were caused accidentally. McKinley was taken to hospital where he was given eight stitches, leaving him with a scar above his eye . She said her dog had always been allowed downstairs in the pub and had never had a problem with the animal previously. She said she was aware of Miss Gledhill and her children in the pub but 'hadn't felt the need' to take Caine upstairs and 'had no worries about him at all'. She told police that she had earlier told the boy to stop bothering the dog who was 'always downstairs just trotting around, lying down'. She added: 'I allow children in my pub because I have six children of my own and 15 grandchildren. I have always said that other children can come in if they are supervised. 'I have had Christmas and Halloween parties in my pub with 20-plus children with no problem. As an animal he is very laid back. He gets bullied by my cat. 'As a general rule if people say ""I'm not playing"" he goes away. Mckinley did go up to him a few times. I had asked him to leave the dog alone - he is not a toy.' But Miss Gledhill, who has since been barred from the pub, told the court: 'I had seen McKinley go up to the dog a few times but it doesn't give the dog the right to bite my son. 'There was a big gash to McKinley's eye and around dogs now he is petrified. When he sees his scar he says he looks ugly. He won't leave the house without a cap on. ' After the hearing she added: 'When it happened at first, I thought a pool ball had hit him in his face. It was all a blur but I wasn't drinking. 'The kids were always within eyesight as the pub is open and their dad was there and all our friends. There are loads of kids there. Attack: CCTV footage from The Oddfellows Arms, pictured, shown to Bolton Magistrates' Court, shows the schoolboy being licked by the landlady's dog before it turns and bites him as he leans in for a cuddle . 'When it happened Mckinley kept saying ""I'm going to die, I'm going to die"". He was braver than I would have been. 'Skin was hanging down and I could see lots of white bits which I guess was his tissue. He was screaming. 'I tried to clean him up and then the ambulance said to put a dry towel on it. In the ambulance I was in shock. He was just covered in blood. 'In hospital the doctor said that if the dog had bitten him a couple of millimetres lower, McKinley could have been blinded. 'He was very lucky. It's heartbreaking when he says he is ugly because of the scars. I feel like crying. 'After it happened we had to get rid of our Jack Russell Rex who was a puppy we'd got at Christmas because McKinley was petrified of dogs. 'Now he is very conscious of his face and he says that his scar can itch and hurt. When I saw the CCTV of the incident I started crying. 'I do understand it is her pet but you don't know with dogs - they can just turn. Another kid could bend down and it could react the same. It could have happened to any kid.' Father Aaron, 32, said: 'I know it's a pub but it's a family pub and there's always lots of kids in there - and I want the dog to be destroyed for what it did to my son.

Liverpool’s fortunes have transformed since Rodgers drastically switched his side’s system to an attack-minded 3-4-3 formation in December; they are the form team in the Barclays Premier League, having taken 27 points from the last 33. The memory of how bad things were in November, though, has not left Rodgers and he has admitted that his experience at Reading, when he was axed in December 2009 after just 20 matches in charge, triggered his decision to rip things up and start again. Liverpool manager Brendan Rodgers speaks to his coaches during a training session at Melwood . The former Swansea City manager shares a joke with Ivorian defender Kolo Toure in training . Rodgers chats to England full back Glen Johnson during the training session at Melwood . Rodgers is highly-regarded by Fenway Sports Group, Liverpool’s owners, and he signed a new long-term contract last May but the 42-year-old knows none of that would have mattered had his side’s results continued on a downward spiral. ‘I certainly wasn’t going to roll over and die,’ said Rodgers, whose side face Burnley On Wednesday. ‘I love it here and I want to be successful. But after the Crystal Palace game (in November when Liverpool lost 3-1) in particular, I felt ""it doesn’t matter how much support you have, the team is not functioning"". ‘It could not go on, really. My experience at Reading told me that. That’s what I learned from that sacking. I went in with the full backing of the chairman, who was great to me. Even though it was a three-year project and they wanted me there, I got the sack after 20 games. ‘I learnt that it does not matter how much support you have in the boardroom, you have to get results – and you have to win. So I needed to make sure that I was going to make decisions which would allow us to get back to at least somewhere near where we were. Liverpool beat Premier League champions Manchester City 2-1 in their last league outing . Midfielders Jordan Henderson and Philippe Coutinho both scored brilliant goals during the win . Rodgers admitted the fear of being sacked had driven him on to turn the club's results around . ‘I think the transformation in the team has been really good to see; to see the confidence, and everyone talking about the system and how dynamic it is, and the fluency. I should have done it earlier! I am an innovative coach and I needed to find a way to make us play better.’ At the lowest point in the campaign, when Liverpool tumbled out of the Champions League and were playing predictably, Rodgers’ was noticeably subdued, particularly before they drew at home to Basel in December. He needed to lift himself as much as his players. ‘We had a huge challenge, probably the biggest I have had as a coach or manager,’ said Rodgers. ‘We had no identity and everyone could see it. We just weren’t the team I had created over a couple of years with an identity for the way we played. ‘I knew I had to do something radical because I had seen enough of the players to know we were not going to be able to shape up and work and play as we had done for the previous couple of years with what we had got.

'This is a life and a piece of French cultural history that has just gone up in flames,' he said.

89c0f51c5e91795dac846aed5cc257857a9624c4,"David Haye insists his long-awaited comeback is still on and is already plotting a route to WBC king – and his old sparring partner – Deontay Wilder. Former two-weight world champion Haye, now 34, has not been seen in the ring since he stopped Dereck Chisora in the fifth round of their thrilling clash at West Ham's Upton Park back in July 2012 . Since then, two fights with British rival Tyson Fury have fallen through, the second of which as a result of shoulder surgery that threatened to end his career for good at the end of 2013. David Haye has vowed to return to the ring after almost three years out of action through injury . Then, last June, Haye revealed that he would fight on and predicted a return to the ring in the following autumn. However he is still yet to re-lace the gloves and it has been suggested that he might never do so again. But 'The Hayemaker' is adamant he will box on, has already set his sights on American knock-out artist Wilder and thinks a world title showdown within just 18 months could be possible. Haye said: 'Yes you will see me back in the ring. I've been taking it easy of late as obviously I had a bad shoulder injury so I needed reconstructive surgery on it. 'That's good now, I've got all the movement back and I'm banging harder than ever with that. I'm just surveying the land at the moment and seeing what's happening out there. 'The heavyweight division is looking as good as it has done for a long time. You've got Wladimir Klitschko still doing what he does, you've got the emergence of Deontay Wilder, the WBC champion, big guy, perfect record. He just had a great win and I was in Vegas when he fought Bermane Stiverne. He looked like the real deal, he really did.' Haye was last in action when he stopped British rival Dereck Chisora at Upton Park in 2012 . Haye knows all about Wilder having shared the ring with him during training back in 2013. Footage of that spar can be found on Youtube and, despite the big gloves and headguard, Haye appears to have the American in real trouble. But it is the 'Bronze Bomber' who now sits on top of the world having beaten Stiverne to win the title, taking his record to 33 wins from 33 fights, with all but one coming inside four rounds. Haye added: 'He helped me out in the past with sparring so I know him very well and I think that has really spiced up the heavyweight division. 'I think a great route would be to go to America and try to navigate a way to the WBC title. Deontay Wilder is a very good champion and if i start fighting regularly I am probably a year or 18 months away from being in a mandatory position to fight him. 'I'm not stupid and I don't think I will just jump straight in there. I think it would be disrespectful to the champions and a bit idiotic of myself to think that just because three years ago I could fight at a good level I can just come straight back . 'Not even Usain Bolt can take three years out and come straight in and expect to beat the world.' It is almost four years since Haye lost a unanimous points decision to Klitschko on a rain-soaked night in Hamburg. Haye twice saw a fight against Tyson Fury fall through after he suffered injuries in training . Since then, all seven of Dr Steelhammer's fights have taken place in Europe. But Klitschko's next outing, a defence of his WBA, WBO and IBF belts against Bryant Jennings, will be at New York's iconic Madison Square Garden on April 25. 'It makes a change,' Haye said. 'In America things are starting to shake up and I think he's realised by continuously fighting in Germany, only German people watch that. 'Worldwide he doesn't do great business and I think he realises time's ticking and he doesn't have many fights left in him. For the next couple of years he wants to really finish his legacy with some really big fights. If he has to travel he has to and he deserves respect for that.' Haye was speaking at a visit to the Double Jab ABC in New Cross as part of Join In and England Boxing's launch of 'Backing Up Boxing'. Their aim is to drive more volunteers to help out at similar boxing clubs across the country. Haye said: 'All of my coaches when I was a kid, from the age of 10 to 20 were volunteers. They weren't getting paid. Out of the goodness of their hearts they came down to Fitzroy Lodge in Lambeth and trained a bunch of kids. 'Even if you don't make a career out of it, there is so much badness out there on the streets on a daily basis. The more youth centres, boxing gyms and football academies, the more stuff we have for kids, stops them smoking, drinking, smoking weed, taking drugs. It's a slippery spiral. 'Hopefully people listening to me will want to try and help. You can go to joininuk.org and see if there is anything you can get involved in.'

The former Castleford and England stand-off won the Man of Steel award in 2011 for his brilliant displays with the number six on his back but an injury crisis has left the Red Devils without three specialist full-backs for Saturday's game against Catalans Dragons in Perpignan. Coach Iesytn Harris has called up youngster Jon Ford in the absence of Kevin Locke, Niall Evalds and Ben Jones-Bishop but admits he is considering moving Chase into the full-back spot. Rangi Chase, pictured in action for England in 2013, could  be set to play at full-back for Salford . 'I'll play wherever,' Chase said. 'I grew up playing full-back in rugby union, so I'm not unfamiliar with it. 'Obviously I've not played there for a while but, if I do get put there, I will have to adjust. 'Obviously when we're attacking it doesn't bother me but defensively you've got to make sure you're in the right spots. I've got to make sure my communication is right if I'm back there.' Chase stepped into the full-back role towards the end of last Saturday's game against Hull after Evalds went off with a pulled hamstring and Harris believes he could perform the role from the start against the Dragons. 'Rangi is a versatile player,' Harris said. 'He can play a little bit of nine if he has to, he can play in the halves, he can play at full-back. He's a natural footballer and he generally creates opportunities wherever he plays on the field. 'And he's very much a team player, he wants to do what's best for the team. The most important thing is Rangi being on the field. It's trying to get the balance right within the team.' Wherever he plays on Saturday, Chase's duel with the Catalans' Australian playmaker Todd Carney promises is a mouthwatering prospect, although the player himself is playing it down. 'I'm not bothered if it's Todd Carney or if it's someone else,' Chase said. 'I'm not worried about him and I'm sure he's not worried about me. At the end of the day, I'll just focus on my own game.' Chase was in masterful form as he steered Salford to their first win of the season against Hull but he admits they will be to take a step up against a Dragons team who are near invincible at the Stade Gilbert Brutus. 'It was a good win in the end,' Chase said. 'We had to dig deep for each other and hopefully we can take some confidence from that. We need to build again. 'It is tough going there. They'are an aggressive side and, when they're at home, they grow even more with their support.

8903a1a88b6623aeae274a70183b63d67b10ce49,"A former friend of controversial Whole Pantry founder Belle Gibson has called on her to 'come clean' on whether her remarkable cancer survival story was based on a misdiagnosis. Mother-of-two Jayme Smith, 28, from Sydney, became a confidant of Ms Gibson's after they met on a parenting discussion page on Facebook around 2010. They forged an online friendship and confided over their experiences with cancer - Ms Smith having lost her mother to lung cancer in 2003 and Ms Gibson saying she had brain cancer. Ms Smith told Daily Mail Australia she was 'baffled' when reports emerged this week where friends raised doubts about Ms Gibson's medical diagnoses and charity donations. 'I am just so shocked and I feel betrayed, that we all fell so hard for the illusion that she created,' Ms Smith said. 'It has hit all of us, who I know, (who) also know Belle, like a tonne of bricks.' Scroll down for video . Jayme Smith (pictured left, with her two children) met Belle Gibson online and maintained a friendship over social media until they had a falling out . Doting mother: Ms Gibson, pictured left with her son Olivier, and right with another friend, founded the popular app and cookbook Whole Pantry . The Whole Pantry (pictured above, in cookbook form) is also a popular app, which costs $3.79 to download. The app is slated to appear on the new Apple Watch . 'We only knew her online, but we all believed to a point that she was a genuine pioneer, who was surviving aggressive cancer. 'Belle and I talked quite a bit about my feelings about (cancer), how she could empathise with me, the feelings I felt about my mother dying and how I'd wished I was more responsible when it happened, that I'd wished I had tried to explore more ideas, like Belle did.' Ms Smith said Ms Gibson 'pushed' - and nearly convinced her - not to vaccinate her children, but that she did not blame her for nearly making that choice, which she 'backed out of at the last minute'. 'That was my own choice, based on information provided by Belle. I regret that choice (to nearly not vaccinate), but it was my own. I'm not here to place blame.' In November 2014, Ms Gibson told Sunday Style magazine she blamed the cervical cancer vaccine Gardasil for her cancer. She told her social media followers last year her brain cancer had spread to her blood, liver, spleen, uterus and that she did not expect to survive. After friends and medical experts cast doubt on her medical claims in various media stories this week, Ms Gibson told The Australian she may have been 'misdiagnosed'. 'It's hard to admit that maybe you were wrong,' she told the newspaper, adding that she was 'confused, bordering on humiliated'. The Whole Pantry, a popular app, gained media attention because of Ms Gibson's remarkable story about cancer survival . The company she founded, The Whole Pantry, said donations to charities that allegedly failed to arrive had been 'accounted for and not processed' and that promised donations 'would be honoured'. Ms Smith told Daily Mail Australia she was 'baffled' by this week's allegations and was most upset about the hope Ms Gibson's followers had invested in her program if she was being dishonest. She said Ms Gibson had the 'gift of the gab' and 'needs to answer to these people (her followers), because they are good hearted people who deserve answers'. 'I don't care about exposing Belle. I haven't spoken to her for months, years. 'I just want her to confirm or deny (her diagnoses) so people who put their faith in her, invested in her - they need to know. 'They need to know, if they've rejected conventional medicine on what she's saying. 'It's their lives, it's not a game.' Ms Smith said of Belle Gibson (above): 'If I saw Belle now, I would just ask her to tell the truth. That's all I want' After three years of sometimes personal exchanges online, Ms Gibson and Ms Smith stopped talking after the development of the Whole Pantry app. 'If I saw Belle now, I would just ask her to tell the truth. That's all I want. 'I don't want to see her beg people for mercy. I don't want her to beg for forgiveness - I just want the truth. 'Come clean, be transparent, let the world know where you're at. If you were misdiagnosed, own up to it. 'Belle DID create an exceptional application, that is loved by many, but I think she should sell it for what it is, complimentary medicines and a diet - not life saving treatment. 'All people want is the truth from her.' Close friends told Daily Mail Australia on Wednesday that Ms Gibson may have left for the United States. Police visited her home on Tuesday night to check on her welfare, but she was not there. Multiple calls to Ms Gibson's mobile rang out. Amid claims that the entrepreneur behind The Whole Pantry app has fled to country, more details about Belle Gibson's past are coming to light. The young social media personality - who came under fire after claims her 'terminal cancer' and incredible survival story from the life-threatening illness were false - once described herself as a psychopath. Ms Gibson has previously gone under the name of Annabelle Natalie Gibson, and tweeted in 2009: @bellmneb: 'Is a distinguished physcopath (sic),' the Herald Sun reported. The next month she sent another tweet, from the account which appears to have been removed. 'Obama won the nobel peace prize.

8e2294ade7ded753fee5160706083b22ba2c49a3,"Chef: Police think Claudia Lawrence was murdered . The detective leading the search for missing chef Claudia Lawrence revealed last night he is ‘actively pursuing new leads’ on the sixth anniversary of her disappearance. Detective Superintendent Dai Malyn, of North Yorkshire Police, said his team had made ‘significant progress’ since the force began reviewing the case in 2013 and may make more arrests in the coming weeks and months. He warned anyone who had not yet disclosed details about their relationship with the chef or the events in the days leading up to her disappearance to come forward or risk arrest. Miss Lawrence was last seen on March 18, 2009, and reported missing by her father on March 20 after concerns were raised when she failed to turn up for her 6am shift at York University. Police believe she was murdered. A number of new searches have been carried out since 2013, including a detailed re-examination of Miss Lawrence's house in Heworth, York, and a fingertip search of the alleyway that leads to the back of her home. A 60-year-old man was arrested last year in connection with her disappearance and suspected murder but was later released without charge, while a 47-year-old man remains on bail on suspicion of perverting the course of justice. Mr Malyn said: ‘In the months since we started our review, we have made very significant progress. We have arrested and interviewed two men about Claudia's disappearance. More arrests possible: Detective Superintendent Dai Malyn (pictured), of North Yorkshire Police, said his team had made ‘significant progress’ since the force began reviewing the case in 2013 . Fingertip search: Mr Malyn said he believes the alleyway near Miss Lawrence's home in the Heworth area of York has ‘potential significance’ in explaining what happened to the chef and is still being investigated . 'One remains on bail while our inquiries in relation to him continue. In the coming weeks and months we may make additional arrests as we continue to develop our lines of inquiry. ‘In the light of information that has only recently come to the fore, we are actively pursuing what are rightly described as new leads.’ Mr Malyn said he believes the alleyway has ‘potential significance’ in explaining what happened to Miss Lawrence and is still being investigated. The detective said some people locally knew Miss Lawrence but have kept their relationship secret and some have deliberately lied about a number of issues concerning their association with the chef, who was 35 at the time. Appeal: Miss Lawrence was last seen in March 2009, and was reported missing by her father Peter (above) Probe: Police believe Miss Lawrence - seen on CCTV on her way home from work in 2009 - was murdered . Map: She did not arrive for a shift at York University . He said: ‘I would make a further appeal for those to come forward now and provide these explanations. ‘If I reach the point where we believe people continue to obstruct this investigation or assist or cover up for the person or persons responsible, they will be arrested.’ Mr Malyn continued: ‘Six years have passed since Claudia disappeared. ‘For her loved ones, the pain caused by her absence and the circumstances of her disappearance has not faded. 'And nor, I assume, has the guilt and knowledge that one or more people have about what happened to this young woman.' He added: ‘Ultimately, we may not be able to prove what happened to Claudia, or be able to find her. 'But that will not be for lack of determination, tenacity and meticulous detective work, nor whilst there are still clues that need to be investigated. ‘If you know what happened to Claudia, or know that you have some relevant information but have not yet come forward, then do so, today. ‘Six years is a long time to live with that knowledge.’","Dai Malyn says North Yorkshire Police has made 'significant progress'

209a61c3ce36a2683efaa2b073c3cd6900dac12e,"A remote island in the Pacific whose residents are descendants of the swashbuckling British sailors and Tahitian women immortalised in the Mutiny on the Bounty movies is set to lose its right to self-rule. Norfolk Island, 900 miles east of the Australian coast and settled by the relatives of Fletcher Christian and other HMS Bounty mutineers in 1856, has about 1,800 residents and has governed itself since 1979. But it is effectively bankrupt and on Thursday, Canberra said it would introduce legislation next week to scrap the Australian territory's parliament. The former military barracks in Kingston, the capital of Norfolk Island, which is set to lose its right to self-rule . Australian Prime Minister Tony Abbott has come under fire for the move - with the descendants of the mutineers leading the opposition. If it passes, the island's legislative assembly will be temporarily replaced by an advisory council, before local government elections in 2016. Personal and business tax will be introduced from July 2016 and residents will in return be able to access social security, healthcare benefits and services enjoyed by Australians. The island, which has it's own native dialect called Norfuk, will no longer run its own immigration, customs, quarantine, education, police and social services, according to The Telegraph. Australia's assistant regional development minister, Jamie Briggs, said the changes were long overdue and it was not sustainable to ask a community of just 1,800 to deliver local, state and federal services. He said the infrastructure on Norfolk Island was run down, the health system is not up to standard and the laws are out of date. 'The community overwhelmingly supports reform and is of the view that the current governance arrangements are not suitable,' he said, adding that Norfolk Island was effectively in administration and reliant on Australian bailouts. 'It is diabolical -- it is quite concerning that it's been left for so long,' he added. Norfolk Island: It is 900 miles east of the Australian coast and settled by the relatives of Fletcher Christian and other HMS Bounty mutineers in 1856 . Romanticised: Actor Mel Gibson played Fletcher Christian in the 1984 film The Bounty, based on the true story . Norfolk Island Chief Minister Lisle Snell said it was unfair to impose such a decision on the tiny outcrop, just five miles long by three miles wide. 'Norfolk Islanders will lose their identity, they will lose their way of life,' Mr Snell told the Australian Broadcasting Corporation. Most of the population are descendants of the mutineers who set Captain William Bligh adrift from British Royal Navy ship HMS Bounty in 1789. The mutiny gained such a romantic gloss that chief mutineer Christian has been portrayed by a series of Hollywood heartthrobs over the years, including Errol Flynn, Clark Gable, Marlon Brando and Mel Gibson. The mutineers settled in Tahiti but later fled, along with their Tahitian women, to remote Pitcairn Island to escape arrest. Some 60 years after arriving on Pitcairn, almost 200 descendents of the original mutineers relocated to Norfolk Island to avoid famine. Queen Victoria granted them the right to settle in the abandoned former penal colony. Forefather: The bulk of the island's ancestors arrived in the late 1700s when the HMS Bounty - the British naval vessel on which a mutiny occurred in 1790 - washed up on the isle, led by Fletcher Christian (pictured)","Residents of Norfolk Island are the descendants of HMS Bounty mutineers .

But Kim Kardashian didn't always look the way she does today. On Sunday her childhood friend Nikki Lund shared never-before-seen photos of the 34-year-old Keeping Up With The Kardashians star taken long before she became an international sensation. Scroll down for video... Old pals: Nikki Lund (right) shared a photo with her childhood friend Kim Kardashian (left) on Sunday . The beauties today: Kim (left) in Paris on Sunday and Nikki (right) in a promo shot for her new song North 2 South - This is It which is doing well on UK charts . Lund, who dates Bon Jovi rocker Richie Sambora, has shared images of Mrs Kanye West before. But never has the singer, whose new song is North 2 South - This is It was released this year, shared so many. In one image Kim looked chubby faced as she shows off bangs and thinner lips. The reality diva also looked more natural with a hearty smile and lack of self-consciousness. Peace out: Lund has shared images of Mrs Kanye West before.But never has the singer, whose new song is North 2 South - This is It was released this year, shared so many . In another she looks older with thin eyebrows, bigger lips and short hair. She appeared to be about 18-years-old. A black-and-white photo shows Kim with braces on and longer hair. She had on dark lipstick and a black tank top that matched her choker. She was 19-years-old when the image was taken. Another portrait sees the two in a photo booth where Kim had bangs. Cool kids of Calabasas?: Kim, at age 19, had braces as a teen and already plucked brows while Nikki wore a nineties style choker . Hats off to them: As teenagers they knew how to do their makeup already and mug for the camera . Lund also talked to The Mirror, where she told the publication her old friend struggled after the loss of her father Robert Kardashian, an attorney, in September 2003. 'Kim was a daddy’s girl, she adored her father and when she died she was devastated,' the singer said. 'Rob was the one who would make sure she was working hard and that she was behaving herself. I don't think this whole thing would be happening to her right now if he was still alive.' Nikki also added that Kim was quiet as a child. 'She never wanted to be famous, it just kind of happened. She was always the quiet girl sitting in the corner while we were all being loud.' Ahhh, this is more like the Kim we know: The E! star looked more like herself in later snaps; here she was in a photo booth with Lund . The friend also said the mother of North West, aged one, was diligent. 'Kim was studious, she wanted to be a good student. She worked hard at school, she didn’t get straight A’s but the teachers liked her. She’d never bunk off school.' And as a teen, Kim had her role models already. 'Kim was  obsessed with Jennifer Lopez, she would sing If You Had My Love all of the time. She thought she was beautiful. She also fancied P Diddy and Jamie Foxx – Kim always liked African-American men.' Interesting insight: Lund said, 'Kim was obsessed with Jennifer Lopez, she would sing If You Had My Love all of the time. She thought she was beautiful. She also fancied P Diddy and Jamie Foxx – Kim always liked African-American men' In to her looks: Nikki also said, 'Kim was always on some sort of diet, we all were. She did the no-carbs thing and would ask for a burger with no bun' Wanting to be like J-Lo meant Kardashian watched her weight. 'Kim was always on some sort of diet, we all were. She did the no-carbs thing and would ask for a burger with no bun. She was conscious of what she looked like, she didn’t have her bum then but the boys liked her. Kim got a lot of attention back then. 'We were a bit dorky really. We loved the Spice Girls, when we were like 15 and 16 and we loved dressing up as them and singing along to their songs. Kim loved Posh Spice, she thought she was the prettiest one and she loved what she wore. 'She went out and bought herself a black leather dress with slits in it – it was exactly like Posh’s. Kim would do her make up like Posh’s and her hair was similar so she did actually really look like her.' They were friends too: Lund arm in arm with Kim's older sister Kourtney, now 35 and a mother of three children . On Sunday,  Kim has been in Paris taking in fashion shows. On Sunday she stepped out in two different looks.

The Telemark Battalion is an elite mechanised infantry unit of the Norwegian Army which has been involved in the fight against the Taliban as part of the NATO-led security mission since 2003. Around 50 soldiers from Telemark will be heading to the city of Irbil in northern Iraq to train Kurdish forces to help them in their fight against Islamic State, the Norwegian ministry of defence has confirmed. It is thought the mission will begin in early April. Scroll down for video . The patch worn by Telemark Battalion soldiers (left), recalls the Punisher symbol of Marvel's comic book vigilante (right), with the words 'Jokke - we will never forget' honoring fallen comrade Claes Joachim Olsson . A Telemark soldier in action in Afghanistan. The battalion has been involved in the fight against the Taliban as part of the NATO-led security mission since 2003 and lost two soldiers in the conflict, including Olsson . ISIS fighters in Aleppo, Syria. Telemark troops are travelling to northern Iraq to train Kurdish Peshmerga forces in their fight against the extremists . Some instructors will also be sent to the Iraqi capital Baghdad in the hopes of stemming an insurgency which now controls large tracts of northern Iraq and Syria. The Telemark Battalion attracted headlines in 2010 when reports emerged some of its soldiers were spray-painting the Punisher symbol on houses and property belonging to Afghans suspected of being members of the Taliban. The Punisher is a Marvel Comics antihero and vigilante who slaughters criminals and mobsters and has a striking skull-shaped emblem. Since the death of Claes Joachim Olsson - known by his nickname 'Jokke' - in January 2010, some members of the unit took to wearing patches featuring the Punisher logo and the words 'Jokke - we will never forget'. The 22-year-old was killed when the storm tank he was travelling in was hit by a Taliban roadside bomb southeast of the village of Ghowrmach in northwest Afghanistan. Telemark Battalion commander Major Rune Wenneberg (pictured centre in the green beret) fires up his troops in Afghanistan with the rallying cry 'To Valhalla!' The insignia of the Telemark Battalion (left), which was lead by the fierce Major Rune Wenneberg (right) Telemark soldiers in Afghanistan, where they became famous for spray-painting the Punisher symbol on houses and property belonging to Afghans suspected of being members of the Taliban . The wearing of Punisher patches was subsequently banned by the Norwegian military leadership, though some soldiers reportedly continued to do so. Following Olsson's death a video emerged of company commander Major Rune Wenneberg firing up his troops with a rousing battle cry name-checking Valahalla, the mystical hall of Norse mythology where specially chosen warriors go after they've been killed in combat. During the footage Wenneberg reportedly cries: 'You are the predator. Taliban is the prey. To Valhalla!', as his troops punch their weapons in the air in support. One former soldier knows who firsthand how ferocious Telemark fighters can be is American Charles Stanley, who helped provide logistics for units from the Norwegian battalion when they underwent two weeks of cold weather training in preparation for deployment to Bosnia in the late 1990s. The 51-year-old, who is a former sergeant in the 82nd Airborne Division of the US Army, told MailOnline they would be a fierce asset to Kurdish Peshmerga troops in their efforts to combat murderous extremists. He said: 'ISIS should fear them for sure. They didn't hold back in work or play and when they went to the task of battle that was all of the business they cared for until the mission was completed. An Iraqi Kurdish Peshmerga fighter is pictured in September 2014 firing at Islamic State positions from the top of Mount Zardak, 25  kilometres east of Mosul in northern Iraq. Fighters like him are soon to benefit from the expertise of the Telemark Battalion - some of the fiercest soldiers in the world . ISIS fighters on the march. Charles Stanley, a former sergeant in the 82nd Airborne Division of the US Army, says the jihadists should fear the Norwegian forces being sent to aid their Kurdish enemies . ISIS has now expanded its reach across much of northern Iraq and holds the city of Mosul, around 90 kilometres from the Kurdistan capital Irbil, to where the 50 Telemark soldiers are being sent . 'ISIS is a force of uncontrolled chaos and they have no discipline or defined battlefield strategy other than overcome by force. 'This well-trained and disciplined unit of Norwegian soldiers would be able to make very short work of any ISIS soldiers they encountered.' Now a director of technology at a Catholic high school in Modesto, California, Mr Stanley added: 'My take on them is that they were a very aggressive and rugged team of warriors. 'They had the attitude of whatever comes our way we will demolish it, be that from eating chow to driving their mechanised vehicles. 'There was no half way with them - it was all or nothing in everything they did. I have a long history with airborne paratroopers and they are some of the toughest soldiers in the army, on and off duty - they train hard and play even harder. 'The Telemark Battalion guys were every bit if not more rough and tumble. 'I would say compared to other country's soldiers they were among some of the most competitive and competent warriors that I have ever worked with. 'When we were in [Operation] Desert Storm [against Saddam Hussein in 1990] their equivalent would have possibly been the French Foreign Legion soldiers as far as ferocity and competence goes.' American Sniper Chris Kyle, who had his own take on the Punisher symbol, which can be seen here on his cap . Kyle's logo, with the Punisher skull and cross hairs . The 11-year veteran of the 82nd Airborne and father-of-one, whose son is currently serving in the US Army, says the Punisher symbol was not being used when he worked with the soldiers. He said: 'That incident didn't happen until later in Afghanistan and I was aware of it and heard the stories. 'That type of scare tactic has been employed for many years by many armies - the Vietnam War had its death card ace of spades, and now they have moved to spray-painted skulls and comic book reference symbols. 'Chris Kyle the American Sniper had his also.' Kyle is known for using a variation of the Punisher symbol himself, featuring the words 'Despite what your momma told you...violence does solve problems'. The Telemark saboteurs back in Britain after the incredible raid. Six Norwegian soldiers destroyed Hitler's nuclear dream in February 1943 at the Norsk Hydro plant near the town of Rjukan, Norway . The Telemark Battalion share a name with a group of legendary Second World War saboteurs. The Heroes of Telemark (pictured), carried out a famous raid which helped thwart Hitler's plans to build a Nazi nuclear bomb. The team successfully destroyed a heavy water production facility at the Norsk Hydoelectric plant in Telemark, a region of southern Norway, in 1943. The raid, which is regarded as one of the most successful acts of sabotage in the whole war, was also remarkable for the fact all the team managed to escape by cross-country skiing 250 miles into Sweden. The heavy water or deuterium oxide which the Norsk plant produced, was essential to the German scientists working on an atomic bomb project and the allies were desperate to destroy it. It was no soft target. Perched on an icy ravine, surrounded by machine gun-toting guards and floodlights the plant was virtually impregnable. But the six-man all Norwegian squad from the Special Operations Executive, trained at Brickendonbury in Hertfordshire, managed to parachute in and get the job done. In what was known as Operation Gunnerside, the raiders broke into the plant and set charges, the explosion of which caused 1000lbs of heavy water to wash away. They then made their remarkable escape, imortalised in the 1964 Hollywood film The Heroes of Telemark, starring Kirk Douglas.","Telemark Battalion is an elite mechanised Norwegian Army infantry unit .

But while these might look like unusually candid snaps of the Royal Family, in reality, they are a clever spoof created by artist Alison Jackson. Inspired by next week's Mothering Sunday, Jackson has tried to imagine how you might treat your mother when she happens to be the Queen. Giving the corgis a bath: Charles and Camilla give the Queen's corgis a bath in a lurid pink bathroom . And according to Jackson, that means hosing down the corgis and carefully giving boiled eggs a regal makeover, complete with bearskin and crown covers. The next photo shows Charles and Camilla, who, as a mother herself will be expecting some treats of her own next Sunday, bathing the corgis in a vivid pink bathroom before drying them off with a patriotic Union Flag towel. Amusingly, the royal couple are seen following the bath up with a blow dry, with Camilla grimacing as Prince Charles accidentally blows hot air in her face. Next comes the big reveal, with the Queen looking thrilled as she is presented with her breakfast tray, a card that reads 'Keep calm and reign on' and three pots of the Body Shop's Vitamin E moisture cream. Anyone for a blowdry? Charles' poor aim leaves Camilla needing to close her eyes . A card fit for a Queen: Prince Charles is seen filling in a card that bears the slogan: 'Keep calm and reign on' Decoration: Charles is also seen giving a trio of boiled eggs a regal makeover, complete with a crown . Finally, Her Majesty is seen sharing her toast soldiers and eggs with her freshly washed - and now very happy - corgis. Jackson is no stranger to reinventing the Royal Family, having previously worked on 'photos' of all the senior royals, including the Duke and Duchess of Cambridge and Prince Harry. Others to feature in her work include Pippa Middleton, who was the subject of her Christmas pastiche, which depicted Miss Middleton desperately attempting to wrap up a corgi for the Queen. More risqué depictions of the Royal Family include a photo of the Duchess of Cornwall on the treadmill clutching a gin and tonic and another of Camilla, this time smoking a cigarette. Doing the wrapping: A suited Charles and a dressing gowned Camilla wrap up their gifts for the Queen . Breakfast in bed: The Queen, clad in a fetching green nightie, looks delighted as she is given her breakfast .

Lukas James Kamay, 26, used leaked market sensitive data provided before its official release by Christopher Russell Hill, 25, to make  millions on the stock market. He used some of the money to buy an apartment renovated on the Nine Network's television show The Block, before his assets were frozen by federal police. Scroll down for video . Lukas James Kamay, 26, used market sensitive data to make $7 million on the stock market to try to buy an apartment renovated on the Nine Network's television show The Block . Kamay from Clifton Hill, north-west of Melbourne, pleaded guilty to six charges of insider trading, one charge of money laundering and two charges of identity theft. He must serve four years and six months before being eligible for parole. Hill, from Belconnen in the ACT, was jailed for three years and three months, with a minimum of two years to be served, for providing embargoed Australian Bureau of Statistics data to Kamay. However, he was unaware of the extent of Kamay's trading. Kamay and Hill had agreed to use the ABS data to make about $200,000 which, after the proper taxes were paid, would result in a net profit of about $50,000 each. Kamay used some of the money to buy an apartment renovated by twins Alisa and Lysandra on the Nine Network's television show The Block . The market sensitive data from the Australian Bureau of Statistics was provided to Kamay before its official release by Christopher Russell Hill (pictured) After a series of trades that netted the pair about $195,000, including some deliberate losses to mimic a normal trade, Kamay opened additional accounts he hid from Hill. The former banker used some of the money to successfully bid $2.375 million on a three bedroom apartment renovated by twins Alisa and Lysandra on The Block. He paid a $500,000 deposit on the Albert Park apartment. Victorian Supreme Court Justice Elizabeth Hollingworth said Kamay's earnings constituted the largest insider trading profit to come before an Australian court. 'Mr Hill had no idea you, Mr Kamay, had gone so far beyond the original $200,000 limit,' she said. Kamay used some of the money to buy an apartment renovated on the Nine Network's television show The Block, before his assets were frozen by federal police .

Lee Cairns, 43, of Wallsend, Tyne and Wear, took a 'running leap' at Stan Roberts, 79, and punched him in the face during the row in North Shields. Mr Roberts suffered cuts and bruises to his nose and cheek, as well as damaged teeth, and said he had 'never been punched so hard in my life'. Pensioner Stan Roberts, 79, was left covered in blood (pictured) after being punched to the ground during a neighbourhood dispute in North Shields . Mr Roberts suffered cuts and bruises to his nose and cheek, as well as damaged teeth, and said he had 'never been punched so hard in my life' The attack took place while Mr Roberts was visiting his ex-wife Yejide Roberts, 38, at her home. The court heard how Cairns' daughter Kelly Lamb, a mother of one, had knocked on Mrs Roberts's door, asking her to move her vehicle from outside Ms Lamb's home. But, despite Mr Roberts moving the car, a heated row broke out in the street between Mrs Roberts and Ms Lamb. The court heard how, minutes later, Cairns stormed down the path and began hurling abuse at Mr and Mrs Roberts. He then attacked the pensioner, punching him once to the face with such force that he collapsed. Before fleeing the scene, Cairns and Lamb then kicked the door of Mrs Roberts's car, leaving a visible dent. Lee Cairns, 43, of Wallsend, Tyne and Wear, took a 'running leap' at Stan Roberts during the violent row, which took place after his daughter Kelly Lamb (left) asked Mrs Roberts to move her car . Then, when police arrived to arrest Cairns at his home, he snatched a baton from one officer and threatened to 'take his head off'. Maimuna Bappa, prosecuting at North Tyneside Magistrates' Court, said: 'There was an argument about where Yejinde had parked and it escalated outside the house with Mr Cairns appearing on the scene. 'At this time the victim remained in the house - he is 79 and suffers from heart problems - but he observed that the dispute was getting out of hand. 'When he stepped out the door, he saw the defendant running down the path to him, draw back his right fist and then punch him in the face. 'He was bleeding heavily from the nose and collapsed back in the house by the living room floor.' The court heard how, after attacking Mr Roberts, Cairns and Lamb both kicked his ex-wife's car before fleeing from the scene. Mr Roberts had gone to visit his former partner when the incident took place . Ms Bappa said Cairns then became aggressive while being put under arrest. The court heard how, while one hand was cuffed, he used the other hand to pull the baton from the officer's belt. He said: 'He raised it above his head and threatened to hit the officer. He said he would ""take the officer's head off"" with the baton.' Cairns, who admitted assault, criminal damage and assaulting a police officer, has now been jailed for 22 weeks. He was also ordered to pay £750 compensation to Mr Roberts and must abide by a two-year restraining order. Speaking after the court case, Mr Roberts said that his ex-wife had been left 'a bag of nerves' following the ordeal. Speaking after the court case, Mr Roberts (left) said that his ex-wife Yejide (right), a trainee nurse, had been left 'a bag of nerves' following the ordeal . He said: 'I am glad he has gone away for what he has done to me and to my ex-wife. 'I am 80 this year and I am starting to feel my age and this certainly hasn't helped. I now see my GP on a regular basis for hedaches and the attack has made the arthritis in my knees worse from being knocked down. 'Yejide is now a bag of nerves and isn't able to use public transport anymore. She is getting counselling and hopes to restart her nursing training soon. 'This has gone on since last July and we are pleased it is over. We hope it is behind us now. He now has time in prison to reflect on what he has done.' Nigerian-born Mrs Roberts add that she had since moved home because of the incident. The attack happened last July at the home of Mr Roberts's ex-wife on this road (file picture) in North Shields, Tyne and Wear . She said: 'It's affected me so badly. I had to move house and I hardly ever leave the house now in case I bump into them in the street. 'It has left me a nervous wreck and affected my career as a student nurse. I hope they get punished.' Chief magistrate Evelyn Harrison said: 'This was a nasty assault on an elderly gentleman, inflicting quite serious injuries and it has had a long-lasting physical and psychological impact.' Richard Haswell, mitigating, said his client suffers from mental health issues and 'behaved poorly' during a neighbourhood dispute. He added: 'He thought his family was being threatened. The only thing that separates him from his daughter is one punch.' Last month, Lamb admitted  criminal damage and was given an 18-month conditional discharge, as well as being fined more than £400 in compensation and costs.","Lee Cairns of Wallsend, Tyne and Wear, took 'running leap' at Stan Roberts .

Fisher Jnr played his last 36 holes in 17 under par, adding a closing 64 to his third round of 63 to finish 24 under par, five shots ahead of England's Matt Ford. South African players have won the Africa Open every year since its inception in 2010, when Fisher Jnr was joint fourth behind former Masters champion Charl Schwartzel. Fellow major winner Louis Oosthuizen won the title in 2011 and 2012, with Darren Fichardt and Thomas Aiken also triumphing on home soil. South Africa's Trevor Fisher Jnr maintained the 100 per cent record of home players in the Africa Open . Fisher celebrates victory with his caddie on the 18th green during the final round of the Africa Open . 'It's amazing,' said Fisher Jnr, who had won eight times on the Sunshine Tour. 'I can't believe it. It's been a long time coming. I've been a pro for a long time. 'I played well. It's always a bit nervewracking leading, you always try not to think about the result but I think I did a good job today of staying in the moment.

'I think it's written in the stars; if you can get out of your own way you can achieve a lot of things. Everyone has to keep trying and keep working.' Fisher Jnr took a two-shot lead into the final round and birdied four of his first seven holes, but a bogey on the fifth meant that four birdies in the same stretch from Ford ensured the gap was cut in half. The decisive moment came on the ninth as Fisher Jnr made birdie and Ford missed a short putt for par, and the world number 271 secured victory in style with four birdies on the back nine - including one from 35 feet on the 18th. Ford plays his second shot into the 11th green during the final round of the Africa Open . 'I made birdie on 16 and knew I had a five-shot lead and it would have been very naughty of me to lose that lead,' Fisher Jnr added at the presentation ceremony. 'Matt's a little British bulldog. He just sank putts and I thought 'Jeez I'm not going to get away from this guy'. He made birdie, I made birdie so it was quite tough and then on nine I made a great birdie and he made a five and that was where it turned around for me and I knew I just had to keep my head up and keep going. 'It's really been tough, I've gone to many tour schools and it's such a tough week. If you don't play well that week you don't get your card.

The tool works in a similar way to its 'tailored notifications' and involves scanning tweets for abusive or offensive words, threats or signs of harassment. It will automatically remove these tweets from a user's notification timeline and repeat offenders may be suspended from the site. Twitter's 'Quality Filter' will scan tweets for abusive or offensive words and threats. It will automatically remove these tweets from a user's notification timeline and repeat offenders may be suspended from the site. It was spotted by Twitter user Anil Dash (pictured) and is only currently available to verified users . The tool was first spotted by Twitter user Anil Dash who wrote: 'Well, that's an interesting and welcome addition, Twitter! (Was prompted about this on opening the app.)' Mr Dash is a verified Twitter user, meaning he has a blue tick on his account. These blue ticks are to confirm that the accounts of high-profile, influential people and celebrities are real and not parodies, for example. A Twitter spokesman said the feature is only currently available for these verified users and did not reveal if it will be rolled out further. It is likely due to the fact such celebrities fall victim to more abuse and harassment than regular users, but Twitter did not confirm this. From Mr Dash's tweet it appears the filter is opt-in. Last week the site took aim at the rising levels of revenge porn and stolen nude photos posted to the social network. Its new rules (pictured) say that users must not 'post intimate photos or videos that were taken or distributed without the subject's consent'. The site said it will verify complaints and suspended abusive users . Reports recently claimed Twitter will  start banning trolls and abusive users by tracking email addresses and phone numbers. When people sign up by email they are also given the option to add a phone number (pictured). In the future, Twitter may  ban accounts accused of abuse until they provide this number . Twitter already lets people block, report or mute people who are sending them abusive messages. Last week the site took aim at the rising levels of revenge porn and stolen nude photos posted to the social network. Its rules now say that users must not 'post intimate photos or videos that were taken or distributed without the subject's consent'. Twitter said an affected user can report a post if they believe it contains photos or videos posted without their consent. Stories of abuse, threats and internet trolls have become commonplace on Twitter in recent years. Robin Williams' daughter, Zelda Williams, left the social platform last year after being sent disturbing images in the wake of her father's suicide. Feminist critic Anita Sarkeesian was threatened with rape, sexual violence and death by Twitter trolls during the 'Gamergate' saga after she criticised the way women are portrayed in video games. In the UK, journalist Caroline Criado-Perez also received rape threats after she voiced her support for the campaign to introduce Jane Austen as the new face of the £10 note. Twitter users Isabella Sorley and John Nimmo admitted sending the messages to Ms Criado-Perez and both were jailed last year. Under copyright laws the video or photos technically belong to the person who took it and who can, in theory, distribute it as they see fit but Twitter's rules additionally considers the people in the footage. It will ask the person reporting the abuse to verify they are the person in the post and that it was posted without their permission. Twitter said 'agents will then act on content posted in violation of the policy', including removing the post or suspending the accounts of repeat offenders. The changes follow reports Twitter would start banning users who violate its rules by tracking  email addresses and phone numbers. This means that if an offender attempts to sign up for other accounts using these details Twitter will be able to intervene. Last month an internal memo sent by Twitter's chief executive Dick Costolo revealed the 51-year-old thinks his site 'sucks at dealing with abuse and trolls'. In the memo, Mr Costolo said  he is embarrassed by the way the company handles abuse and that it must take stronger action in the future. Mr Costolo's comments were posted on an internal forum among Twitter employees, after one employee raised the question of what more could be done to tackle online abuse. In December, a blog post titled 'Building a safer Twitter' revealed  Twitter is working on ways to make it easier to block and report abuse. The site has since improved the reporting process to make it more mobile-friendly, and it now requires less initial information. It has also improved the ways in which abuse can be reported to law enforcement.","Twitter is currently trialling the feature on accounts of verified users only .

25b544d7014e9cee1b9aa1b71c696d943042e4c8,"(CNN)There is a controversy brewing about Starbucks and its new ""Race Together"" campaign.  The ubiquitous coffee shop company was mocked for its decision to have its employees write the words ""race together"" on its coffee cups and start a discussion on race. But what's so bad about that?  Shouldn't we commend Starbucks for trying to be good corporate citizen, to walk the talk, as it were? Starbucks CEO Howard Schultz announced the company's new campaign this week, which he described as ""an opportunity to begin to re-examine how we can create a more empathetic and inclusive society.""  In other words, grab a cup of coffee and let's talk about race. ""We have problems in this country with regard to race and racial inequality,"" Schultz said in a video to corporate employees. ""We believe we're better than this, and we believe the country is better than this. There is a need for compassion, empathy and love towards others."" And he has indicated that the new move is not mandatory for its employees. This is what Schultz calls ""conscious capitalism.""  It is an example of businesses who want to serve the community, get ahead of the curve rather than pander to what they think customers want, and show that they care about something other than getting paid. theGrio.com: Creflo Dollar is further proof that prosperity gospel is full of 'false profits' Of course, we would be foolish to think that Starbucks or any company would engage in such a strategy separate and apart from a profit motive.  After all, the company, like any other money making enterprise, wants to make more money.  And capitalism is all about making money.  And yet, there are different pathways to getting there, and maybe Starbucks is showing us a new way. Perhaps you think that their approach is corny, and yes, the company has faced a lot of attacks online for their stance.  But the attacks are distracting us from a very important problem, one which many people would rather not discuss, with or without their coffee. Clearly some people do want to talk about race, and there is a desperate need to confront the issue head on.  What we are witnessing as a society is a new movement led by black women and spurred by the killing of black people such as Michael Brown and Trayvon Martin, Renisha McBride and Eric Garner, John Crawford and Tamir Rice, and many more, whether by police or by armed vigilantes. theGrio.com: Blacks are treated 72 percent as well as whites . People of all colors and persuasions have participated in #BlackLivesMatter, #ICantBreathe and #HandsUpDontShoot protests and die-ins across the nation.  Race is part of the town hall, the public square.  It always has been, but what is different now is that the issue is once again being placed on the front burner. It only makes sense that actors and players in society, including corporations such as Starbucks, would want to become part of that new dynamic. At a time when so many corporations are coming under fire for their questionable, exploitative, even deadly business practices, Starbucks is trying to be a responsible corporate citizen and part of the solution. Corporate America makes a great deal of money, and just as some corporations have benefited historically from slave labor and exploitation, some corporations today attempt to get ahead by cutting corners, underpaying their workers with poverty wages, cheating their customers with bad mortgages or polluting the environment.  Meanwhile, other companies take a completely different approach and realize that by giving back to the community, supporting worthwhile causes, and initiating important discussions not only helps their bottom line, but improves society's bottom line. Of course, we cannot pretend that having a talk about race over coffee will solve America's problems, just as President Obama's ""beer summit"" over the racial profiling of Harvard Professor Henry Louis Gates fell short of fully capitalizing on one of those ""teachable moments."" theGrio.com: Let's stop the 'struggle equation' Race in the United States is not merely about who likes or who doesn't like you, or who calls you the N-word or does not want to live next to you.  Racism is a system of power dynamics and institutions that must be made to change.  But these institutions are made of people, and people do have to talk.  And drink coffee.  And who knows what can happen when people start to talk about race? Maybe they will even think about things in a different way. So, let's not attack Starbucks for doing the right thing and getting the ball rolling on race.  The only thing worthy of criticism is that other companies haven't done it, and that's something that needs to change.

a81ea0b6e6f1b47fba659d97b3fde63d0e088b5f,"Ferguson, Missouri (CNN)Ferguson's police chief and other city officials are already out. Now some residents have told the Missouri city they'll try to oust the mayor, too. Five residents Friday filed an affidavit saying they'll try to force a referendum on whether to remove Mayor James Knowles -- capping a tumultuous week in a community grappling not only with last year's fatal shooting of teenager Michael Brown, but also Wednesday's wounding of two police officers shot during a protest. A group supporting the filing, Organization for Black Struggle, a 35-year-old St. Louis-based activist group, said the five would try to collect enough signatures -- 15% of the city's registered voters -- in the next 60 days. The five ""initiated recall (attempt) due to Mayor Knowles' failure to adequately rein in an out-of-control police department during the protests following Mike Brown's death,"" the activist group said. The city government acknowledged Saturday that it received the affidavit. Earlier this week, the police chief and the city manager resigned in the wake of a U.S. Justice Department report alleging institutionalized racism at just about every level of Ferguson's municipal government, including the police department. Residents elect City Council members, who in turn appoint the city manager. The city manager directs and supervises all city departments, including police. The top municipal court clerk was fired earlier in connection with racist emails. This month's Justice Department report was initiated after one of Ferguson's police officers, Darren Wilson, shot and killed African-American teen Michael Brown in August, a shooting that spurred months of protests. Wilson, a white officer who said he shot Brown in self-defense, will not be charged in the case -- a grand jury declared it wouldn't indict him in November, and the Justice Department said this month that it would not bring federal civil rights charges in the case. Wilson resigned from the department in November, citing security concerns. Knowles indicated Friday he won't be stepping down. ""I think it's important to recognize that there's a lot of people who may be angry at the situation; there's a lot of people who are frustrated in this community with the way things have gone down,"" the mayor, who is white, told CNN. ""But there's a lot of people who still -- and who have expressed this to me -- express confidence in both my willingness, and members of the (City) Council's willingness, to listen, to be responsive, and to make changes as necessary,"" he continued. ""People in the community recognize this, now, not everybody. I didn't win every time with 100% of the vote. But I can tell you there are ways to remove me if that is the will of the people,"" the mayor said. Blake Ashby, a white resident of Ferguson, said Friday that he believed Knowles has ""consciously tried to reach out to all parts"" of the city of 21,000 people. ""If we lose Mayor Knowles, we lose a force for change, and it will be harder to make the changes that the DOJ (Department of Justice) is asking for,"" Ashby said. Rasheen Aldridge, a black member of a commission charged with recommending reforms in Ferguson, said  that Knowles needed to resign in the wake of the DOJ report. ""He knew what was going on during his watch,"" said Aldridge, a member of the Ferguson Commission, which Gov. Jay Nixon formed last year. Investigators still are seeking breaks in the case of two police officers who were shot Wednesday night during a protest in Ferguson. While the demonstrators' focus was Ferguson, neither of the wounded officers works for that police department. One is from Webster Groves, a St. Louis suburb 13 miles south of Ferguson. The officer -- a 32-year-old with seven years' experience -- was shot at the high point of his cheek, just under his right eye, police said. The other was hit in the shoulder and the bullet came out the middle of his back. He is a 41-year-old officer with the St. Louis County Police who has been in law enforcement for 14 years. Both were treated and released. ""I cannot tell you an arrest is imminent, and there's certainly no one in custody,"" St. Louis County Police Chief Jon Belmar told reporters Friday afternoon. ""The detectives are working this investigation around the clock, and they will not rest until we have a conclusion in this investigation,"" the chief said. Police have ""several leads,"" he said. ""I think we have a pretty good general idea of where we think the shots came from."" Sara Sidner reported from Ferguson, Missouri. Jason Hanna reported and wrote from Atlanta. CNN's Ed Payne and Michael Martinez contributed to this report.","Group says mayor failed to rein in police during protests after Michael Brown's 2014 death .

9000fbb12c1d996d2574b89c34fa55a37f38c8c9,"A new and unlikely fashion trend has emerged in Colorado for sporting jewelry in the shape of IUDs - birth control implants otherwise known as intrauterine devices. Wearing the glittery, brightly-colored objects as earrings or, in the case of men, lapel pins, is a show of support for a new bill which would plunge $5million in state funding into a program which supplies this form of birth control to low-income women. The jewelry has been purchased by more than 200 lobbyists and lawmakers in favor of the Colorado Family Planning Initiative, from web retailer Etsy, and is crafted out of resin by Dr Virginia Smith, an OB-GYN based in Ohio. Trending: Wearing these IUD replicas is a show of support for a new bill which would allocate $5million in state funding into a program which supplies this form of birth control to low-income women in Colorado . IUDs are small T-shaped implants which, when inserted into the uterus, prevent pregnancy from occurring for between three and 12 years, or simply until removed. IUDs (intrauterine devices) are small T-shaped implants which are fitted into the uterus to prevent pregnancy. They work by interfering with the way sperm usually fertilize an egg, and are more than 99% effective. IUDs last anywhere between two and 12 years, depending on the type. The implants must be fitted and removed by licensed healthcare providers. Once they are removed, a woman can generally become pregnant straight away. The Colorado Family Planning Initiative has handed out an estimated 30,000 of these contraceptives since its inception in 2009, and up until now, has been grant-funded. According to ThinkProgress, this program has contributed to a 40per cent drop in teen births over the past five years. The new legislation, expected to be introduced on Friday, would allocate $5million of state funds to the cause, allowing IUDs to be fitted for free or at little cost in 68 clinics across Colorado. Some conservatives and anti-choice lawmakers, however, stand against the program, with some - including Republican Senator Kevin Lundberg - even incorrectly claiming IUDs cause abortions. Dr Jennifer Hyer, a Denver-based OB-GYN, dismissed these claims as neither 'medically' nor 'scientifically' accurate, in a statement distributed by NARAL Pro-Choice Colorado. 'They are among the most effective forms of contraception, especially for at-risk women, because they automatically prevent pregnancy,' she said. Glittery: The resin jewelry has been purchased by more than 200 lobbyists and lawmakers in favor of the bill, from web retailer Etsy, and is made by Dr Virginia Smith, an OB-GYN based in Ohio . Republican House Rep. Don Coram is actually in disagreement with members of his own party on this issue, and has taken to wearing one of Dr Smith's IUD pins on his lapel as a sign of his support for the bill. 'A redneck Republican wearing an IUD - it just doesn't make sense does it?' Mr Coram told The Herald. 'Seriously though, I think this is one of the most important bills we are looking at.' Dr Smith, who has seen business for her IUD jewelry go through the roof recently, told ABC's 7News Denver: 'I think women should have access to options and so if this promotes access to options then I think that is a good thing.'","The earrings and lapel pins, which cost $20, are sold on Etsy and made by Dr Virginia Smith, an Ohio-based OB-GYN .

Shortly after Vasquez was last seen, he had called a friend saying he was 'screwed' and had lost his way. The economics major and soccer star at the prestigious school had then lost contact. Reports said he was likely drunk at the time. His cousin Logan Crespan told DailyMail.com: 'He said he was going to the beach when he left the party but the closest beach was 15 miles away.' Vasquez's mother, Wendy Margolin, said that at around 2.20am her son had called a friend, Aurora, Cardenas, and told her he was 'screwed' and did not know where he was. Last seen: The star soccer player had no money of ID on him when he left the party, authorities say . Swim: His cousin Logan Crespan (left) told DailyMail.com he said he was going to the beach, which is 15 miles away . Close: It is unclear what type of vehicle hit the student. 'The family is understandably very distraught and has respectfully asked for privacy,' police said. Above, Vasquez was killed just blocks away from the fraternity . 'He pretty much said, ""I need you to come over here, I need help."" I asked him, ""Where are you?"" and he told me that he was in LA and that he didn’t know where he was at and that he was lost,' Cardenas told NBC Bay Area. 'The second time he called it just clicked. I didn’t know if his phone died, or if he hung up.' Addressing the media Sunday, Ms Margolin said her son was very responsible and dedicated to his studies, and that it was it out of character for him not to contact his family and friends. Vasquez's parents drove to Los Angeles from Northern California Saturday to join the search for their son. Margolin was planning to scour doughnut and candy shops open late in the area. Meanwhile, his friends were visiting lifeguard towers in Santa Monica and Venice Beach. A missing poster described Vasquez as a six-foot, 175lb Hispanic man with dark hair and brown eyes. Last contact: Wendy Margolin (left), Eloi's mother, said a friend of her son's, Aurora Cardenas (right), got a call from him at around 2.20am Saturday telling her he was 'screwed' and lost . Appeal: Friends, relatives and teammates shared his missing poster in a bid to track him down before receiving the tragic news that he was actually struck and killed by a vehicle on the state's 10 Freeway . He was wearing a white and red t-shirt, white plimsolls, and gray chinos when he died after leaving the party on the 600 block of W 28th Street, a fraternity hub known locally as 'Greek Row'. Vasquez was not a member of a fraternity. Relatives told police he did not have any money or identification with him at the time. He did have a cell phone on him, but it appeared to have died. Cal Athletics released a statement Sunday addressing Vasquez's disappearance. 'Eloi is a wonderful young man who has excelled both academically and athletically here at Cal,' the press release said. 'Our entire Cal Athletics family is very concerned for Eloi’s safety and our first priority is to help in any way we can to locate him.' Vasquez, born in Novato, California, was an accomplished soccer player who trained at France's esteemed Racing Club Strasbourg Alsace and the youth academy of Pachuca in Mexico. Athlete: Vasquez, who has trained at soccer camps in Mexico and France, was wearing a white t-shirt and gray pants at the time of his disappearance and death . Getting the word out: Friends described him as a 'really special kid' in Twitter appeals . He had also played for the California Golden Bears. A fellow player, Matthew Powell, tweeted a picture of Vasquez, writing: 'My former teammate, Eloi Vasquez, is missing...last seen at USC. Really special kid, keep spreading the word.' In a statement at the weekend, the university said: 'Eloi is a wonderful young man who has excelled both academically and athletically here at Cal. 'Our entire Cal Athletics family is very concerned for Eloi's safety.'","Eloi Vasquez, 19, vanished in the early hours of Saturday after leaving a party at the University of Southern California fraternity Tau Kappa Epsilon .

But scientists have now found that Macaque monkeys show similar signs of depression to humans, such as shying away from a group, losing their appetite and adopting a hunched posture. By studying creatures in a social situation, they hope to learn more about why humans may become depressed, which could improve treatment for the debilitating mental disorder. Scientists have found that Macaque monkeys show similar signs of depression to humans, such as shying away from a group (shown in E) and adopting a hunched posture (shown at A, B, D and E). Image C suggests bullying from dominant monkeys (marked in the pictures with red arrows) in the form of a cut to the monkey's ear. Intimidating behaviour (B and D) may explain the monkeys' depression . Previous studies have used rodents, which 'do not realistically resemble the etiopathological [causal] development of depression, which occurs naturally in a social context,’ according to the study, published in Nature. Researchers at Chongqing Medical University, China, and Wake Forest University in North Carolina, examined depression in cynomolgus macaque monkeys living in social colonies at Zhongke Experimental Animal Co. in Suzhou, eastern China. The cause of depression in some cases, appears to be down to bullying behaviour by dominant members of the colonies, such as intimidating and even attacking lower status monkeys. Each colony was made up of two males and approximately 20 females as well as their offspring, reflecting how they would live in the wild. Twenty females showing symptoms of depression, such as no interest in food, grooming or mating. Dominant behaviour is marked with red arrows, above and depressed monkeys with blue arrows. Feeding: The depressed monkeys spent less time eating and drinking than their healthy peers. Behaviour: They spent less time resting on elevated perches such as shelves and hanging chains, which are favourites with healthier and more dominant monkeys. Movement: Depressed subjects spent more time sitting on the floor and less time walking around. Grooming: The sad monkeys spent less time grooming each other and being groomed, which is a sign of sociability in healthy monkeys. They also spent less time taking care of themselves, by scratching, for example. Nursing: They also nursed their infants less than healthy monkeys. A total of 52 colonies were observed and 1,007 female monkeys screened for depression, Real Clear Science reported. Twenty females showing symptoms of depression, such as no interest in food, grooming or mating, were chosen and compared to 20 ‘happy’ monkeys and 10 that had been kept in isolation and were also thought to be depressed. The researchers found that the naturally depressed and isolated monkeys behaved in a similar way, such as ‘stereotypical prostrated and socially unresponsive posture as well as exacerbation of socially submissive behaviours,’ the study said. Naturally depressed monkeys  displayed a slumped posture, less interest in feeding and sex and diminished communication and reciprocal grooming with others. 'One to two subjects per stable social colony (17–22 subjects) manifested a depressive phenotype that may be attributed to psychosocial stress,’ the study said. The authors believe that their monkey model of depression mimics real life and is closer to how depression develops than humans (illustrated with a stock image) than rodent models . As well as behavioural changes, they also identified metabolic differences between depressed and healthy monkeys, which has also been witnessed in humans. The healthy monkeys spent longer feeding and drinking compared to their depressed peers who were not as interested in eating, for example. The authors believe that their monkey model of depression mimics real life and is closer to how depression develops in humans than rodent models. ‘This model's stable depression phenotype demonstrates superior validity to traditional rodent models of depression by better approximating the psychosocial stressors encountered by adult humans living in a resource-based competitive society and can aid further investigation into the mechanisms underlying depression,’ they wrote.","Experts from universities in China and North Carolina studied monkeys .

150983a21198dd21d6a80625823c5e25be959cee,"Teacher Kim Davies, pictured, vowed that she would have no problems in being a whistleblower again despite being reprimanded by a watchdog . A teacher who complained about an unruly pupil and went on sick leave was spied upon by the local education authority while she was on sick leave. Kim Davies, who has taught English for the past 28 years, faced the prospect of being hit with a classroom ban following allegations of misconduct. A General Teaching Council For Wales (GTCW) hearing in Cardiff was told Mrs Davies became a thorn in the side of education officials after lodging more than 20 complaints about a colleague and nine to an exam board. The 56-year-old was later followed by a team of private investigators after her dispute with bosses saw her signed off by a doctor on grounds of stress. Caerphilly County Council took the drastic action after suspecting the mother-of-two was defrauding the sickness absence system - but the Information Commissioner's Office later ruled the local authority was wrong to begin the surveillance. However, she was still hauled before the GTCW - who found she had broken confidentiality rules about her disciplinary procedure as well as making 'vexatious' complaints. Among the penalties available to the body included striking Mrs Davies' name from the teaching register - a move she said would have not only cost her job but also her home. A panel decided against the more severe sanctions - and said she can carry on teaching provided she promises not to cause problems again. Mrs Davies denied being a troublemaker and said she was 'fighting injustice' after her complaint about a pupil's behaviour was not taken seriously. She said: 'I am relieved that I am able to carry on teaching. I don't know what I would have done if that was taken from me - it would have had a massive effect on my welfare and happiness as well as my financial circumstances. 'I've been through four years of hell - not only has there been the prospect of losing my home but also my job. 'But despite everything that I have been through it would not put me off on blowing the whistle again. 'This issue unravelled following a complaint about the safety of pupils and staff. It is the job of a teacher to ensure pupils are safe in the classroom. 'I care too much about my pupils and their welfare. 'Even though they decided the allegations against were proven, I always believed what I was doing was right. 'And if you can live with your conscience, then you can survive.' The GTCW heard that Mrs Shaw, from Blackwood, south Wales, became embroiled in a row with bosses at Pontllanfraith Comprehensive School after lodging a complaint about a problem pupil's 'threatening behaviour'. After feeling the issue was not taken seriously, she was subject to disciplinary proceedings in 2010 before finally being dismissed two years later. During her period of suspension, it was found she breached confidentiality rules during the school's internal disciplinary processes and made 'vexatious allegations' to exam board WJEC in an attempt to bring the school into disrepute. Case presenter Lousha Reynolds said the registrant also behaved inappropriately towards her line manager, her head of department and headteacher Robert Davies - whom she called 'an idiot' and referred to him being in his 'ivory tower'. Ms Reynolds added: 'She felt her behaviour was justified because she wanted to make people pay, because she felt a sense of injustice. 'We heard today that she didn't want the education of pupils to be jeopardised, but there is still no insight into her failings. 'She was only suspended because of the way she acted towards her disciplinary proceeding.' Ms Davies had raised issues at Pontllanfraith Comprehensive School, pictured, about a 'problem pupil' However, while the row rumbled on it emerged that Caerphilly Council paid private investigators £3,600 to tail Mrs Shaw for three days - a move the Information Commissioner's Office later called 'unlawful'. In mitigation, Mrs Shaw told the GTCW she had been absolutely devastated by the events of the past four years. 'I had built up a reputation over 28 years in one school and to have that questioned and to be accused of malpractice decimated everything I believed I stood for,' she said. NASUWT representative Colin Adkins told the hearing Mrs Shaw believed she was being disciplined after raising 'a serious safeguarding matter'. He said: 'Mrs Shaw believed that was done by challenging her professional integrity, which she found personally devastating. 'She has suffered a serious detriment already - financially and personally - for pursuing matters she believed she was right to pursue. 'I believe the public interest is best served by allowing Mrs Shaw to continue teaching. Quite clearly, she's a good teacher.' Panel chairman Steve Powell said the GTCW was satisfied Mrs Shaw failed to 'behave professionally' during her disciplinary process and her actions 'fell short of what is expected of a registered teacher'. Mrs Shaw, who has been a supply teacher for the past two years, was handed a conditional registration order. It means she can carry on teaching provided she fulfils certain requirements, such as any employer having to submit a report on her progress. Following the decision, she said: 'I'm still trying to take in the implications of what this means but for now I just want to get back doing what I do best - teaching.'","Teacher Kim Davies made more than 20 complaints against a colleague .

South Korea's president President Park Geun-hye visited injured U.S. Ambassador Mark Lippert on Monday amid an outpouring of public sympathy and support for the envoy who is recovering from an attack by a knife-wielding man . Hospital officials said they expect to release Lippert on Tuesday as he recovers from his injuries . Lippert has been hospitalized since Thursday at Seoul's Severance Hospital, where President Park Geun-hye also received treatment in 2006 when she was knifed by a man with a box cutter during an election rally . Park's office said the president went to the hospital shortly after she returned to South Korea on Monday from a Middle East tour. Park was quoted as saying 'my heart is aching more' because Lippert is hospitalized at the same hospital due to a similar attack. Lippert told Park that he and his wife have been moved by the support the South Korea government and people have showed to him, according to a statement from the presidential Blue House. Conservative activists and Christians have wished Lippert a quick recovery, held pro-U.S. rallies and conducted dance performances near the U.S. Embassy in Seoul. High-level government officials and politicians have visited him, and one well-wishing man even tried to offer dog meat to him. Hospital officials said they expect to release Lippert on Tuesday. 'He has strongly expressed his desire to go back to work,' said Yoon Do-heum, general director of Severance Hospital said. The alleged attacker, known as an anti-U.S. activist who was previously convicted of hurling a piece of concrete at the Japanese ambassador in Seoul in 2010, was arrested Friday.

Police said the exact motive for Kim's action was not known but he shouted after the attack that he opposes the ongoing U.S.-South Korea military drills that Pyongyang condemns as a preparation for a northward invasion. Police said Monday that some of the books, computer disks and other materials found at his home support rival North Korea, which could result in charges of violating an anti-Pyongyang security law. Critics want the law abolished, saying past authoritarian rulers have used it to suppress their political opponents. The two Koreas have shared the world's most heavily fortified border since the 1950-53 Korean War ended with an armistice, not a peace treaty.

bf3d573cba02bae0609133e207d23d0954cd82db,"Labour and the SNP are 'half way down the aisle' to stitching up a deal to put Ed Miliband in Number 10, the Tories claimed today after Nicola Sturgeon dropped the party's red line over nuclear weapons. Ms Sturgeon said the SNP would still be prepared to put Mr Miliband in Downing Street even if Labour refused to scrap Britain's Trident nuclear deterrent – a key plank of the nationalists' manifesto. The Scottish First Minister said the SNP would never vote to renew Trident but she insisted there were 'many issues we could agree on'. Ms Sturgeon played down the prospects of a formal Coalition, but said the SNP could prop up a Labour government 'on an issue-by-issue' basis. Nicola Sturgeon said the SNP could still do a deal with the Labour Party even if Ed Miliband insists on renewing Britain's Trident nuclear weapons . She said: 'On that basis, there are many issues we could agree on which we would support but we would not vote for Trident.' Ms Sturgeon's remarks, to the Guardian, come amid growing pressure on Mr Miliband to rule out going into Coalition with the SNP in a bid to stem the party's loss of support in Scotland. Tory chairman Grant Shapps said Ms Sturgeon's move opened to door for a deal between Labour and the SNP after the election. He said: 'Ed Miliband and the SNP have signed the pre-nup and are now half-way up the aisle. 'Day after day, vote after vote in Parliament, Ed Miliband would be forced to negotiate with Alex Salmond - the man who tried to break up Britain - about how to run Britain. 'Make no mistake: an Ed Miliband government, propped up by the SNP, would mean more debt than our children could ever hope to repay, higher taxes on hardworking people and economic chaos for our country.' A Labour government propped up by the SNP - handing Mr Miliband the keys to Number 10 - moved a step closer after Nicola Sturgeon dropped a red line over Trident nuclear weapons . Scotland will be able to 'call the tune' at Westminster after the general election, according to Alex Salmond. The former First Minister, who is standing for the Gordon constituency in May, said neither Labour or the Conservative 'are fit to govern' and believes a large group of SNP MPs will lead to 'progress for Scotland'. Working with Plaid Cymru and the Green Party, Mr Salmond hopes to 'shake Westminster to its foundations, to rumble up the House of Commons'. Speaking ahead of a constituency meeting in the village of Insch, Aberdeenshire, he said: 'It is now clear that neither Tory or Labour will win an overall majority. Neither are fit to govern. 'It is also clear that Scotland is swinging behind SNP candidates the length and breadth of the country. In that situation Scotland can call the tune in the next Westminster Parliament. 'Now thoughts should turn to what that tune should be. Nicola Sturgeon has laid out a clear strategy and key priorities. 'We cannot give any support formal or informal to the Tories because of their track record of hostility to Scottish interests and the total bad faith of David Cameron towards the Scottish people the day after the referendum. 'However, support for any other administration comes with the conditon of progress for Scotland. 'Progress to fully deliver the promises on real powers that were made to the Scottish people during the referendum. Progress to signal an end to austerity economics with all the damage that this is doing to the country and finally common sense progress in stopping the waste of countless billions on new nuclear weapons.' It comes after a poll of marginal constituencies in Scotland revealed that a dramatic surge by the SNP could see Labour lose almost 40 seats north of the border. The survey, by the Tory peer Lord Ashcroft, showed the SNP could win as many as 56 of Scotland's 59 seats – up from just six at present. The SNP surge would claim seats held by a string of household names, including Gordon Brown, Alistair Darling and former Liberal Democrat leader Charles Kennedy. The poll suggests that Labour and the Conservatives would end up being tied on 272 seats each – well short of the 326 needed to command a Commons majority. But a Labour government could be propped up by the SNP – handing Mr Miliband the keys to Number 10. However, Labour's Scottish MPs are urging Mr Miliband to rule out a deal with the SNP ahead of the election in an attempt to reverse his party's dire poll ratings north of the border. Scottish Labour is holding its annual conference in Edinburgh this weekend. Former Prime Minister Sir John Major has also warned Labour against doing a deal with the SNP. Sir John claimed 'the SNP would enter into any agreement with Labour with one overriding aim: to break up the United Kingdom'. Writing in the Daily Telegraph, he said: 'Labour now have to make a choice. 'They must summon the courage of their convictions and declare their intent. The British people – north and south of the border — do not deserve to be misled. Labour must remove any doubt. 'If the outcome of the general election is inconclusive, will they refuse to govern with the support of a party whose principal aim is to break up the United Kingdom?' The SNP said that Labour would 'not be forgiven by the people of Scotland' if they refused to work with the Nationalists. Deputy leader Stewart Hosie said: 'For a former Tory prime minister to tell Labour what to do on the eve of their conference in Scotland is hugely embarrassing for (Scottish Labour leader) Jim Murphy. 'John Major wants the Tories to be re-elected in May, and therefore he wants Labour to rule out an agreement with the SNP, because that would stop the Tories.' 'There are no circumstances in which the SNP would put the Tories into government - the question is if Labour have the same commitment, with a number of senior Labour figures promoting voting Tory in Scotland, and even the idea of a 'grand alliance' between the Tories and Labour.","Scrapping Britain's Trident nuclear deterrent is a key SNP policy .

db700e5436cb72370dee5866894b86f4f0803673,"When Adam Scott waved a short putter to magical effect during the first round of the WGC-Cadillac Championship at Doral on Thursday, he effectively consigned to history one of the most contentious subjects the game has known. Nine months ahead of the official death knell for long putters, the great and good have seemingly imposed their own sanction. The banishment was started by Ernie Els and Webb Simpson, who snapped his over his knee to ensure he would not be tempted any more. Then came Keegan Bradley, leaving Scott as the last man standing in terms of players who won majors using a long putter. Australian Adam Scott putts for birdie on the eighth green during the WGC-Cadillac Championship . Scott watches his tee shot on the 14th hole in the second round of the WGC-Cadillac Championship . It was this group who forced the hands of the governing bodies when they claimed all four majors between them in the space of just 18 months, from Bradley's PGA Championship triumph in 2011 through to Scott's Masters victory in 2013. The authorities were persuaded by the powerful evidence that less nerve was needed in anchoring a long putter to the body and the plain inequity that such a crutch could prove decisive at a major. Hence the ban on anchoring which, by extension, meant the end for long putters. Scott was the most high-profile since his long putter was the ugliest contraption of all. As long as he kept turning up with it in his bag, the subject rumbled on. It was during a three-month break that the genial Australian decided it was time to change. His caddie Steve Williams had announced his retirement while Scott's wife had given birth to their first child, Bo. 'Everything was getting a little boring so I thought why not change everything completely and ditch the putter as well,' said Scott (right), wryly. At home he experimented with a range of 50 different putters. He tried various grips and methods. By the time he arrived in Miami, Scott was confident enough to announce he was going back to the short putter he last wielded in competition in 2011. Scott plays his second shot on the 10th hole in the second round of the WGC-Cadillac Championship . The Australian chips the ball out of the bunker and onto the 11th green at the WGC-Cadillac Championship . The 34-year-old admitted to some first-hole nerves and genuine concern as to how it would hold up over long putts. As things turned out, it went better than he could have imagined. Using the 'claw' grip favoured by Sergio Garcia, the putting stroke looked pure and he had just 27 putts in an opening round of 70. 'I'm really pleased,' Scott said afterwards. 'I've tried not to clutter my mind and I've shown myself it is not that big a deal. It helps that I used a short putter for years, so the adjustment was really to do with muscle memory.' One or two middle-ranking players such as the Swede Carl Pettersson and South African Tim Clark still use long putters. But even here they will surely take encouragement from the example of those at the top. As for Scott, did he ever feel like following Simpson's example and snapping his putter in two? 'It treated me pretty well, so I don't think it deserves a snapping,' he said, smiling. Scott's two-under-par round left him in the top 10 but still eight strokes behind runaway leader JB Holmes, who carded a 62. 'That's the most unbelievable round I have ever seen,' said Ian Poulter, who opened with a 74 — one worse than world No 1 Rory McIlroy. For Holmes, it was another heartening milestone in his remarkable recovery from brain surgery three years ago. The 34-year-old Scott watches his tee shot on the 12th hole at the WGC-Cadillac Championship .","Adam Scott is now using a short putter at the WGC-Cadillac Championship .

c252adcb6421005a1f9e729f0492ed5431f8aa8d,"Ed Balls today ambushed George Osborne on live TV by forcing him to agree to take part in a head-to-head election debate on the economy. The Tories had tried to argue that they would not discuss the idea of a clash between the would-be Chancellors until the leaders' debate had been resolved - which seems unlikely. But appearing together on BBC One, Mr Balls forced Mr Osborne to shake on the deal, raising the prospect that it could be the only televised election debate between the two parties before polling day. Appearing together on BBC One, Ed Balls forced George Osborne to shake on the deal, raising the prospect that it could be the only televised election debate between the two parties before polling day . Mr Balls insisted Prime Minister David Cameron may be 'scared' of a one-on-one debate with Labour leader Ed Miliband but he was up for the showdown with Mr Osborne. After he was put on the spot, the Chancellor shook Mr Balls's hand but suggested Danny Alexander, Liberal Democrat Chief Secretary to the Treasury, should be included. Speaking on BBC One's the Andrew Marr Show, Mr Osborne said he was sure an election debate between the different finance spokesmen of the parties would take place. Asked if he was keen on the debate, shadow chancellor Mr Balls replied: 'Of course, and I would like to go further. George and I don't need the broadcasters to sort these things out. Mr Osborne tried to claim that his Lib Dem deputy Danny Alexander should be included as well . 'George is not a coward. David Cameron doesn't want a head-to-head with Ed Miliband but I'm very happy - I will have a head-to-head debate, just the two of us, the potential chancellors during the election campaign. Addressing Mr Osborne, he said: 'You can say now - are you up for it?' The Chancellor replied: 'As I say, happy to have these chancellors' debate, just as we did in the last election.' Mr Balls extended his hand out to Mr Osborne to shake on a one-on-one debate, telling the Chancellor: 'Come on George, let's go for it.' Mr Osborne appeared hesitant, saying he would be happy to meet Mr Balls in a debate. He shook the shadow chancellor's hand, adding to Mr Balls: 'We're going to see who else wants to be part of it. I have got a very effective Chief Secretary who I think would also want to be part of that debate.' Mr Balls added: 'If only David Cameron was up for a one-to-one debate like George, it would be alright - for some reason David Cameron is running scared.' Mr Osborne said: 'I think we should include Danny Alexander.' Mr Balls countered: 'No, one-to-one. We just shook on it.' Speaking on BBC 5 Live's Pienaar's Politics, Mr Balls said he was unsure if Mr Osborne had agreed to the debate or not. He said: 'He started shaking hands and he was agreeing to a head-to-head debate with me. By the end of the handshake it sounded like he wanted to bring along his deputy Danny Alexander. 'It was clear and then it was unclear. I thought George Osborne was going to do what David Cameron has ducked for weeks and weeks. 'He started the handshake doing it - by the end, constructive ambiguity I think.' Labour's Ed Balls squirmed today as he repeatedly refused to rule out entering a power-sharing deal with the SNP. A surge in support for the Scottish Nationalists looks set to deprive Labour of a majority and leave Nicola Sturgeon's MPs holding the balance of power. Lib Dem leader Nick Clegg today vowed never to enter coalition with a party which wanted to break up the union. Uncomfortable: Shadow Chancellor Ed Balls appearing on BBC One's The Andrew Marr Show today . But Mr Balls refused to match the promise, despite being challenged as many as 12 times during a TV interview. He would only say that Labour has 'no plans, no need, no desire' for a pact with the SNP. Challenged on BBC One's Andrew Marr show, Mr Balls said parties who ignore the need to tackle the country's deficit are 'completely wrong' and 'irresponsible'. But his opposition to the SNP did not stretch to categorically ruling out sitting in Cabinet with them. Told by Mr Marr to say the words ""I rule it out"", Mr Balls replied: ""Ed Miliband said it's nonsense. It's not part of our plans. 'You know Andrew, you've been covering politics for 30 years, parties, large parties at this stage say we're fighting for a majority and we are. 'I'm not going to get involved in speculation about post-election deals. 'We're fighting for a majority.'","Labour shadow chancellor bounces his opponent into agreeing to contest .

Monye won 14 England caps between 2008 and 2012 (pictured celebrating against Fiji at Twickenham) 'It is a decision that I have been thinking about for a long time, and one that I haven't taken lightly,' Monye said. 'I have had an unbelievable 13 years at Quins, and look back on my career with no regrets. 'I can honestly say that the one thing I am most proud of is that I have been a one-club man in a game that is ever-changing, and I am excited to be staying on at the club after my retirement in a different capacity.' London-born Monye has made more than 230 appearances for Quins, and the club's rugby director Conor O'Shea paid him a glowing tribute. Monye also played in two Tests for the British & Irish Lions, and scored a try against South Africa . 'In my time here, two things stick out to show his unwavering commitment and professionalism to the only club he has ever played for,' O'Shea said. 'The first was when he was offered twice the money we were offering to join a top French club, but he turned it down to be with the club he always dreamt of playing for. 'My second memory will be how he got back on the field for our Aviva Premiership title win in 2012. 'He tore his hamstring, but within four weeks - and against all medical expectation - he got himself back on the pitch and played the full 80 minutes (in the final against Leicester). 'He will be missed, but he will always be one of the true greats of this club, and also one of the great ambassadors of the game.'","Ugo Monye will end a 13-year playing career at the Twickenham Stoop .

28efe544cf18a63ca31ed08a364031604aed194b,"Carlos Mars, 19, is facing assault and weapons charges . Police have arrested a 19-year-old student in connection with a stabbing at Morgan State University that left three football players injured. Police said Wednesday that Carlos Mars has been charged with assault and weapons charges. The stabbing happened Tuesday afternoon when a fight broke out between two groups of students at the Baltimore-based campus. Police say two men were slashed, one across the chest and one in the back, and a third student suffered abrasions. Charging documents show that a witness told investigators that Mars 'repeatedly and aggressively' stabbed another student in the chest during a fight. But Mars told investigators he 'swung his knife around in a wild manner' to keep students away from his friend, who also was involved in the fight. Police say Mars remains in jail. It was the third instance of violence on the Baltimore campus in less than a week. The players were taken to hospitals and their injuries were not considered to be life-threatening, police said. University spokesman Clint Coleman said one of the players was slashed across the chest and another was cut on the arm. Police place a person of interest in a police cruiser for transport from a scene where a stabbing took place at Morgan State University . An investigator peers into a trash can at a scene where a stabbing took place. It's the third incident of violence at Morgan State University in a week . He said a third person was cut on the cheek; police said a third person was stabbed in the back. The reason for the discrepancy was not immediately clear. It's not clear what started the fight. This is the third instance of recent violence. On Friday, a male student was stabbed with scissors by his roommate after an argument over the cleanliness of their dorm room. Early Saturday, an on-campus party was broken up after fights started. School officials held a campus meeting Tuesday night to talk about what happened. 'We expect you as students to take responsibility for your own behavior and actions,' University president David Wilson told those in attendance. Two groups of people got into a fight outside a dining hall on the Morgan State University campus, and some football players were stabbed by someone swinging a knife wildly, police and college officials said . History: Morgan State is the largest historically black university in Maryland and has about 6,000 students . Earlier Tuesday, Wilson sent an email to students that declared 'This is not Morgan!' Kevin Banks, vice president for student affairs, repeated that assertion. 'The stuff you've seen on TV the past few days is not Morgan State University,' Banks said. Wilson also said no text alerts were sent to students immediately after the stabbing because 'the general public was not in imminent danger because this was a fight between known parties and not a random act of violence.' But Freshman Shakia Marine, 20, who did not attend the campus meeting, said she is a little worried about the latest spate of violence. 'My godfather has concerns about me coming here,' Marine said. 'There needs to be more security guards walking around. After today, it made me feel scared. My roommate said we should get some Mace to protect ourselves. I think the school needs to take more action. It's not the first time something like this has happened.' Morgan State is the largest historically black university in Maryland and has about 6,000 students, according to its website. Rules: Morgan State says a zero tolerance policy for fighting is now in effect and violators will be suspended .","Carlos Mars is currently being held at the city jail .

But now the number 12 has cropped up in another mystifying setting - on a baby's forehead. Hanru van Niekerk was born in Johannesburg, South Africa on November 11, 2014, with a strange birthmark on his face in the shape of digits '1' and '2'. Scroll down for video . Special: Little Hanru van Niekerk was born with a birthmark shaped like the number 12 on his forehead . Cute: The family of the little boy, who lives in Johannesburg in South Africa, spotted the markings soon after he was born on November 11 2014 . Doctors have reassured the family of the boy, now four months old, that the markings will gradually fade with time. Great grandmother Catherine Jooste told the Northcliff Melville TImes that they have embraced the peculiar birthmark, which was a 'beautiful surprise'. She said: 'My youngest daughter was the first one to see it and she said there is a 1 and a 2 on his forehead. 'We did not worry about it, his doctor said it will fade as he gets older.' According to NHS Choices, birthmarks come in two main categories, vascular or pigmented. Vascular birthmarks tend to occur in the head or neck area, being caused by abnormal blood vessels in or under the skin, which can fade after a few months. In comparison, pigmented birthmarks are tan or brown-coloured, caused by a cluster of pigment cells. Most birthmarks are harmless and don't need to be treated.","Little Hanru van Niekerk was born with the number 12 on his forehead .

8f4f5e93c967e15ca1ee63d6a18189912f5b75ed,"The Christian feast of Holy Thursday is a generally somber affair, but  it also carries a daunting, if less religiously significant, challenge for food lovers. What would you have for your Last Supper? Unsurprisingly, celebrity chefs such as Anthony Bourdain and Donatella Arpaia want more from their final courses than a simple breaking of bread. Deciding on a final meal has been a long-time game among chefs, though deciding which flavors would be their last has never been easy. Photographer Melanie Dunae brought the question to the masses with her My Last Supper books, though she provided help from some of the sharpest and most famous knives in the kitchen. Chefs such as Gordon Ramsay, Bobby Flay and Rachael Ray made choices ranging from cheeseburgers to  pastas to elaborate truffle dishes to Yorkshire pudding. One thing they'd have in common, however. The meal would probably be pretty good no matter what they decided to cook. Donatella Arpaia . Donatella Arpaia said that her Last Supper would be handmade spaghetti with fresh tomato and basil sauce . The American Iron Chef judge, 43, would go out after an Italian meal that stayed true to her family's roots. 'I would pick handmade spaghetti with fresh tomato and basil sauce, along with freshly baked focaccia, some thinly sliced prosciutto and burrata,' the chef, who recently opened a pizzeria, told the New York Post. 'My first taste sense memory when I fell in love with food was spaghetti with tomato sauce and basil one summer in Capri. It was love at first bite, and I want it to be my last bite as well.' Mario Batali . Mario Batali would go to Italy for his final meal and set himself a huge feast with bruschetta and other seafood pasta dishes . Batali, 54, would want to return to the Amalfi coast in Italy, and dine on a huge multi-course dinner starting with bruschetta and including a main course of a shrimp and zucchini pasta, scialatielli ai gamberetti. The feast would also include mussels, sauteed shrimp dishes and limoncello vinaigrette grilled lobster. However, the former Food Network chef and owner of restaurants around the world would not cook his final meal, preferring to let a local woman prepare his favorite dishes. Michelle Bernstein . The Miami-based Michelle Bernstein would go for a number of dishes made by her mother before the end, but would start with lemon oysters . Michelle Bernstein, a James Beard award-winning chef who runs two restaurants in Miami, said she would take a particularly long time with her final meal so she could 'slow down and taste every morsel.' She would start off with a dozen lemon oysters before asparagus on top of her mother's potato pancakes. The 46-year-old would then pick dishes from her favorite chefs, such as Gary Danko and Alain Ducasse including braised foie gras with truffles and lobster. Bernstein, who claims a mix of Latin and Jewish heritage, would also eat her mother's lasagna and upside-down pear cake before a range of pastries and her own banana cream pie. Anthony Bourdain . Television host Anthony Bourdain has traveled the world but would take his final meal of bone marrow at St John in London . Anthony Bourdain, 58, has probably gained the most fame for his travel show, but still serves as chef-at-large at New York's Brasserie Les Halles. He said he would want his final meal to be at St John in London prepared by its chef Fergus Henderson. Bourdain, who said he would like to be alone for his last bites before the grave, would not linger at the table, preferring only roast bone marrow with parsley and a caper salad accompanied by some baguette slices. The well-traveled chef would enjoy his final meal with a Guinness. Bobby Flay . American chef Bobby Flay kept it simple and decided on a 'crunchified' burger with a light draft beer . Though other chefs longed for foreign shores and truffles in their Last Suppers, 50-year-old American chef Bobby Flay would keep it simple with a cheeseburger. The star of numerous Food Network shows would jazz up his final morsel with chipotle ketchup and  jalapenos, and 'crunchify' it with potato chips on top of the meat. Though he contended that the beer is not the important part of the meal, Flay said that he would have a light draft such as a Coors. Desert would be an ice cream sundae with a cherry on top. Anita Lo . Anita Lo, chef of New York City's Annisa, said that her last meal would incorporate both French and Asian cuisines along with sweetbreads and truffles . Anita Lo, the chef of New York City's Annisa, said that her last meal would include her favorite ingredients, sweetbreads and truffles. She enjoys mixing French and Asian cuisines and would continue doing so up until her final course. Lo, who has famously competed on both Top Chef and Chopped: All Stars, would also include sushi in her Last Supper. Maria Loi . Manhattan restaurant owner Maria Loi's last meal would take her back to her homeland of Greece, including a very specific type of oregano . Originally from Greece, Maria Loi would stick with the food she loved in childhood. 'I’d have freshly baked crusty bread with Greek extra virgin olive oil,' she said. The owner of Loi Estiatorio would mix in feta cheese and a perfectly ripe tomato, though she would need to make a long journey to find the perfect spice. Loi said that her final meal would require dried Greek oregano, but only from Mount Taygetos, . Jamie Oliver . Celebrity chef Jaimie Oliver said that he would have spaghetti all'arrabiata for his final meal, as well as rice pudding . If he was facing impending death, Englishman Jamie Oliver would turn to his comfort food, spaghetti all’arrabiata with three types of chilies. Oliver said that he would take the meal at his house in Essex and eat rice pudding with carmelized roast peaches for desert. The 39-year-old would wash it all down with a bottle of Hoegaarden beer. Gordon Ramsay . Gordon Ramsay has been asked about his Last Supper multiple times, most recently saying that he would have roast beef . The Scottish-born chef, famous for ripping apart budding proteges on his shows such as Hell's Kitchen, would settle down for a roast dinner before shuffling off the mortal coil. The 48-year-old would choose roast beef with Yorkshire pudding and red wine gravy, according to TIME. He would also listen to the first album of the musicians Keane while eating it in his London home and drinking Bâtard-Montrachet wine. Ramsay also previously told the Guardian that he would have black Perigord and white Alba truffle with his roast . Desert would be chocolate fondant and white milk ice cream. Rachael Ray . The Food Network's Rachael Ray said that she prefers to think of her meal happening in heaven, and would eat spaghetti aglio e olio with her grandfather . The star of her own self-titled show, Rachael Ray said that she wouldn't be able to enjoy her last meal. However, once she went to the great beyond, Ray said she would like to eat spaghetti aglio e olio with large amounts of anchovies, garlic, parsley, chili and EVOO. She said her departed grandfather would cook fish with potatoes, tomatoes, onions, wine and lemon. Ray said she and her grandfather would drink Sicilian wine.","Chefs have decided what they would have for last meal for a long time .

a63465aa8744a4a65c2c7050b301c21e4bf53e8a,"Boston (CNN)Eight minutes of sheer terror. That's what police officers from Watertown, Massachusetts, described in heart-stopping detail Monday, revealing details of a chaotic shootout with the Boston Marathon bombing suspects. One of the suspects, Tamerlan Tsarnaev, died from injuries he sustained that day -- wounded in a gun battle, then run over by his brother, Dzhokhar. Dzhokhar Tsarnaev managed to escape, but was later caught by police. Now he's on trial, facing 30 charges for the marathon bombings, which killed three people and injured more than 260 others. The shootout with police in the early morning hours of April 19, 2013, marked one of the most dramatic chapters in the manhunt for the suspects who paralyzed the Boston metropolitan area for days. It started, patrolman Joseph Reynolds testified, soon after he locked eyes with Tamerlan Tsarnaev, who he spotted driving an SUV that matched a description of a stolen vehicle. Reynolds called for backup. It wasn't long before Tamerlan and Dzhokhar Tsarnaev were firing guns, throwing bombs and trying to run officers over with a stolen SUV, Reynolds said. ""Tamerlan Tsarnaev got out of the driver's side door and began shooting at my cruiser,"" Reynolds said. Soon, the officer said he ran out of bullets. Sgt. Jeffrey Pugliese saw what looked like muzzle flashes as soon as he arrived at the scene. ""I put my vehicle in park, I took a round through the windshield, I was sprayed with glass and I knew, OK, we were being fired on,"" said Sgt. John MacLellan. Then the two brothers began throwing improvised explosives, including pipe bombs and a pressure cooker bomb, the officers testified. ""I noticed one was bigger than the other, and they had different styles when they were throwing the devices,"" MacLellan said. ""One was throwing like a baseball."" MacLellan said the pressure cooker bomb ""was incredibly loud. I had to holster my weapon. My eyes were shaking violently in my head. I couldn't see."" Pugliese said he opened fire when he saw one of the men, Tamerlan Tsarnaev, charging toward him. Pugliese fired and the man threw his pistol at the officer, hitting him in the bicep. Pugliese tackled him. And with Tamerlan Tsarnaev, who was wounded from gunfire, on the ground, the three officers tried to put him in handcuffs. They thought they'd be able to arrest him. But then something changed. ""We were wrestling with Tamerlan, and all of a sudden I could hear an engine revving,"" Reynolds said . The SUV, Reynolds said, was heading straight toward the officers. The dramatic descriptions of the shootout Monday sounded like a scene from a Hollywood film, said Boston Globe columnist Kevin Cullen. But the most extraordinary revelation in court, he said, was that the night could have ended very differently. ""Dzhokhar Tsarnaev did not have to go back and run his brother over. He actually did a three-point turn and reversed the vehicle. He could have sped off and run away,"" Cullen told CNN's ""The Lead with Jake Tapper."" He was in a much better position to flee. But apparently he decided to do a U-turn and come back."" The sight of the stolen SUV speeding toward them caught the officers by surprise. ""I reached down and I grabbed Tamerlan by the back of the belt and tried to drag him out of the street so he wouldn't be hit,"" Pugliese said. ""The black SUV, it was right in my face. ... I kind of laid back and felt the wind from the vehicle as it went by."" But they didn't move Tamerlan in time. His body became hung up in the rear wheels and he was dragged a short distance, Pugliese said. The prosecutor asked Pugliese if there was something in the road that forced the SUV driver to go directly at the officers. ""No,"" he said. ""It was accelerating at a very high rate of speed."" Later that day, Tamerlan Tsarnaev was pronounced dead at a local hospital, with the cause listed as ""traumatic injuries"" to the head and torso. His fingerprints led to the identification of the suspects. Officers discovered that Richard Donohue, a Massachusetts Bay Transportation Authority officer, had been hit by friendly fire during the shootout. He survived, but nearly bled to death. Dzhokhar Tsarnaev was arrested about 8:45 p.m. that same day, hiding in a boat called the ""Slip Away"" that was stowed in a backyard in Watertown. Jurors saw photos of the boat last week. But on Monday, they got a chance to see the boat, which has become a key piece of evidence in the trial, in person. Before the trial started, prosecutors and defense attorneys had sparred over how much of the boat jurors would get to see. The prosecution sought to remove a panel on which Tsarnaev allegedly scrawled incriminating messages so that jurors could see it with their own eyes. Defense attorney David Bruck argued that cutting out a panel would take the written words out of context and wouldn't fairly reflect Tsarnaev's state of mind. In South Boston, about a mile from the courthouse, jurors intently looked at the entire boat Monday. It had been loaded onto a semi truck and moved to the location for viewing by the jury. Dzhokhar Tsarnaev, wearing a dark jacket and no handcuffs or shackles, watched the jurors but showed little emotion or expression. Jurors appeared to strain to make out the words Tsarnaev scrawled inside the boat. The boat was riddled with more than 100 bullet holes -- some of which punctured Tsarnaev's words. Aaron Cooper reported from Boston. Catherine E. Shoichet and Ralph Ellis wrote the story in Atlanta. CNN's Jake Tapper and Ann O'Neill contributed to this report.","3 police officers described an intense gun battle with Boston Marathon bomb suspects .

2d48fbf53690ffd860efeffc6643d55cc9947daa,"(CNN)A new Justice Department report on Ferguson's police and courts could not be more clear: Change is needed. The 102-page report details widespread and systemic discrimination against blacks at the hands of officials -- painting probably the clearest picture yet of what the rule of law looks and feels like in the Missouri city. It includes 26 recommendations. The report is scathing in its critique, and clear about what needs to happen next, but it doesn't address the question: Who, if anyone, is responsible for what took place? Are individual officers to blame? Is the police chief? What about city officials who repeatedly pushed police to increase revenue through ticketing, resulting in disproportionate targeting of African-Americans? Writing for CNN, criminal defense attorney Mark O'Mara argues in favor of gutting the entire police department, and starting from scratch. So far, one person has been fired; two more are on administrative leave. Are more heads likely to roll? ""When the attorney general said that the Department of Justice has made certain recommendations, those aren't necessarily just recommendations. The Ferguson police department and municipal courts will have to reform. This is a must-do situation. We're talking about wholesale reform,"" said CNN legal analyst Sunny Hostin. ""And I would be very surprised that any of the leadership remains."" Mayor James Knowles said the two employees on leave are awaiting the results of an internal investigation. ""Department of Justice officials informed the city of Ferguson that a review of city emails uncovered explicit racial bias by three individuals who are employed by the city of Ferguson police department. Let me be clear: This type of behavior will not be tolerated in the Ferguson police department or in any department in the city of Ferguson,"" he told reporters Wednesday. ""The three individuals were placed on administrative leave pending an investigation. One has since been terminated."" A source said the two employees ""will not survive the investigation."" CNN senior legal analyst Jeffrey Toobin criticized the mayor's response, seemingly suggesting that more needed to be done in the wake of the Justice Department report. ""You read this report, and, one officer loses his job? You know, you translate the bureaucratic gobbledygook of the mayor, that's all that happened there,"" he said. Surprisingly to some, controversial Police Chief Tom Jackson remains at the helm. So does Knowles. Although the report is limited to correcting action going forward, people affected by past abuses do have the option of filing civil lawsuits against specific individuals. Such cases are not easy to bring, according to Peter Joy, a law professor at Washington University in St. Louis. ""In a court of law, the findings of this report wouldn't even be admissible,"" he said. ""Basically, you'd have to prove each allegation."" Joy gave an example of person who paid a $100 fine that was unjustly levied. Finding lawyers who would take an individual case like that would be tough, he said, because there is no guarantee they could recover on behalf of their client, and the amount of damages could very widely. Practically, that person may be out of luck. But if the Justice Department gets its way, illegal or improper behavior on the part of police and courts in Ferguson could soon be a thing of the past. ""It is time for Ferguson's leaders to take immediate, wholesale and structural corrective action,"" said Attorney General Eric Holder. ""The United States Department of Justice reserves all of its rights and abilities to force compliance and to implement basic change. Nothing is off the table."" CNN's Sara Sidner contributed to this report.","So far, one person has been fired; two more are on administrative leave .

A new coin portrait of Her Majesty has been unveiled by the Royal Mint and will be used on currency from this year. The effigy, which was designed by engraver Jody Clark, is only the fifth official coin portrait made during the Queen's 63-year reign and replaces the current one, which first appeared in 1998. Scroll down for video . New look: The latest coin portrait of the Queen has been unveiled by the Royal Mint . Familiar: The profile, which shows the Queen in the George IV diadem, will be used on coins from 2015 on . Unlike the previous one, which shows Her Majesty in the Girls of Great Britain tiara, the new portrait shows her wearing the George IV State Diadem and a delicate pair of  drop earrings. Commissioned in 1820 by George IV, the diadem, which is most often seen during the State Opening of Parliament, has 1,333 diamonds and 169 pearls, arranged in rose, thistle and shamrock designs to represent England, Scotland and Ireland. Like its owner, the diadem also has a long history of appearing on coins and bank notes, having appeared on currency belonging to the UK, Australia, Canada and the British Caribbean territories among many others. The new portrait was chosen from a selection of anonymously submitted designs, with creator Jody Clark becoming, at 34, the youngest engraver ever to create a royal coin portrait. Likeness: The new portrait is an updated version of the Ian Rank-Broadley design, created in 1997 . Creator: 34-year-old engraver Jody Clark, from the Lake District, created the winning design . New look: The new coin portrait is only the fifth to be produced during the Queen's reign, with the first in 1953 . 'I really liked the four previous coin portraits - each one is strong in its own way,' says a delighted Mr Clark. 'I hope that I’ve done Her Majesty justice and captured her as I intended. 'The news that my design had been chosen was quite overwhelming, and I still can’t quite believe that my royal portrait will be featured on millions of coins.' Speaking about the decision to award Mr Clark the job, Kevin Clancy, director of the Royal Mint Museum, said the judging panel’s decision was 'pretty unanimous'. Mr Clark, who is originally from the Lake District, says his family are 'really proud', adding: 'They’ve had to keep quiet about this. 'It’s going to be hard to top this. It’s going to take a while to sink in. I’m really happy with how it’s turned out. I can only hope everyone appreciates it.' The first coin portrait of the Queen's reign appeared in 1953, shortly after she took the throne, and was designed by Mary Gillick. Heading for your wallet: The new coin will be introduced this year . Although the four subsequent designs show her wearing a crown, her first portrait showed a fresh-faced young Queen wearing nothing more than an evergreen wreath. That all changed when a new coin portrait entered circulation in April 1968, which showed a sterner version of the Queen in the George IV diadem. The image, which was designed by Arnold Machin, was replicated on stamps and remains one of the most famous portraits of the Queen ever created. In 1985 came another new coin portrait, this time by Raphael Maklouf who once again showed the monarch in the George IV diadem. Unusually, the new portrait proved controversial with Maklouf accused of making the effigy 'flatteringly youthful'. Unimpressed, he swiftly hit back at critics, telling them his intention had been to create something 'regal and ageless'. For the fourth coin portrait of the Queen, which replaced Maklouf's design in 1997, Her Majesty chose to wear the magnificent Girls of Great Britain tiara. The gem, which was made for Queen Mary on the occasion of her wedding in 1893, is one of the most spectacular in the Royal Collection and features 13 brilliant-cut diamonds as its centrepiece. Along with its appearance on the 1997 coins, it was also worn by the Queen to marry the Duke of Edinburgh in November 1947.

But a new biography of the New York governor says he had a larger part in the unraveling of the marriage, which briefly united two political dynasties. Vanity Fair's Michael Shnayerson alleges in 'The Contender' that the couple started talking 'not if but when' to divorce just two months after the birth of their third daughter Michaela in 1997. However, Cuomo dragged out the break-up for years - possibly to use his wife's political clout to fuel his failed 2002 gubernatorial run, the book alleges.

The former couple pictured above on their wedding day in 1990 . The New York Daily News, which previewed the book, cited Shnayerson's sources who said the couple learned they were incompatible fairly early on in their relationship. Shnayerson did not interview Cuomo himself. Shnayerson quotes a Douglas Kennedy - Kerry's 46-year-old younger brother -  who says that while Cuomo treasured the connection to the Kennedy family, he loathed participating in reunions at the family's estate in Hyannis, Massachusetts and eventually stopped going altogether. Douglas Kennedy said on one occasion, when the Kennedys spent a night partying and singing, Cuomo stood by 'looking disgusted'. Douglas also described Cuomo as a 'bully' who thought many member's of his wife's family as weak or 'political'. Not if, but when: Author Michael Shnayerson says in 'The Contender' that Cuomo and Kennedy started talking not if 'but when' to divorce just two months after the birth of their third daughter Michaela in 1997. The couple pictured above with twins Cara Ethel and Mariah Matila, with father Andrew holding baby Michaela . Staying together for the campaign: Kennedy allegedly decided to stay with her husband during his ultimately failed 2002 run for governor. According to the book, the couple agreed to break-up after the campaign, but Cuomo kept putting it off . The Contender, written by Vanity Fair writer Michael Shnayerson, is due out March 31 . Perhaps one of the most painful digs at the Kennedy family was the Manhattan party that acted as the informal launch for Cuomo's 2002 campaign for governor. At the party, the Rolling Stones song 'Sympathy for the Devil' was played at high-volume - a song which deals with the assassinations of both President John F Kennedy and Kerry father's Robert F Kennedy. The Kennedy's who were in the room for the party were aghast, but it's unclear if Cuomo was behind the decision to play the song. Disdain for the in-laws wasn't the only issue between the political couple. Kerry Kennedy and Cuomo harbored ill-feelings about the little things too, the book claims. When she first started dating Cuomo, Kennedy allegedly 'rolled her eyes a bit' when she saw the plastic covers he kept on his furniture. And a friend close to one side of the former couple told Shnayerson that Cuomo wasn't dazzled by his wife's cooking, cleaning or even the 'dowdy' way she dressed. By the time Cuomo started planning his 2002 run for governor, his wife agreed to stay with him through the campaign. But when the campaign failed, Cuomo allegedly asked her to stay together for just a little longer. The breaking point for Kennedy, according to Shnayerson, came when Cuomo confronted her for having an extra-marital affair with polo player Bruce Colley. A 'closer observer' told Shnayerson that Kennedy told Cuomo to mind his own business, break the news to the kids and move out of their home. 'After 13 years of marriage, and truly stressful times, I knew the ties that bound us together had frayed,' Cuomo wrote in his autobiography All Things Possible, published late last year. 'But I had hoped we could work through what I saw was a difficult time, not an end. Obviously, I was in denial.' 'Even though Kerry had told me she wanted a divorce I thought I could fix it, I couldn’t accept it — it only became real when a reporter called and said she filed the papers.' Breaking point: The couple officially divorced in 2005. Cuomo eventually won the New York governorship in 2011 - the same year he started dating celebrity cook Sandra Lee.

The couple originally said their break-up was amicable, but that didn't last long, according to the book. Soon an attorney for the Cuomos started spreading stories about Kennedy's betrayal. Cuomo did eventually win the New York governorship in 2011 - the same year he started dating celebrity cook Sandra Lee. Kerry Kennedy still lives near her ex-husband in Westchester, New York. Last week on Wednesday, their youngest daughter Michaela was rushed to the hospital when she was found unconscious at her mother's home.

56b687fd9b64bf5f5564350a475cf2dc7033e2c7,"A man who was brutally beaten and left for dead after witnessing his mother's murder is still fighting for justice 36 years on - and says he knows who is responsible for her death. Eric Garrett, from Muncie, Indiana, was just four when a man entered the home he shared with his mother, 22-year-old Paula Garrett, on March 25, 1979 and savagely beat them with a blunt object - killing her and fracturing the little boy's skull. A few weeks later, when he was finally well enough to speak with police, he named the attacker as Richard Green, his mother's on-off boyfriend and a married father-of-four. Even though prosecutors concluded Green was not responsible for the attack, Garrett continues to stand by his childhood claim, while neighbors have also recounted the couple's troubled relationship. Witness: Eric Garrett, pictured left, is calling for a new investigation into the 1979 murder of his mother, 22-year-old Paula Garrett, right. He says he saw her boyfriend in their apartment before the attack . 'This case isn't unsolved, it's just unprosecuted,' Garrett, now 40, told NBC News. Paula Garrett and Green had met at the restaurant where Paula worked as a waitress and the night before her death, he was at her apartment, investigators told NBC's Dan Slepian. Green told police that he left late that night and then visited her apartment the following afternoon, where he came across her body. He then alerted neighbors. But family members told NBC's Dan Slepian that Green had been possessive and abusive, and that Paula had been trying to break up with him at the time of her death. A neighbor, Larry Smith, added to NBC that he often heard the couple fighting and the night she was killed, he heard Green shout: 'You think you're going to get away with this?' The following day, Green barged into Smith's apartment and told the neighbor that Paula had killed herself, he said. When Smith rushed into the apartment with Green, 'I immediately realized this was no suicide', he said. 'Blood was everywhere.' He also noticed that her son was covered in blood on the ground but was opening his eyes. He picked up the boy's limp body - all while Green did nothing, Smith said. When Eric was well enough to speak to police, he named the man and picked his photo from a lineup. He told NBC that he had been sleeping when Green walked in and switched on the light, giving him a good view of his mother's killer. But a defense team today would raise issues with Garrett's claims, considering his age, the passage of time and the injuries he sustained in the attack, experts told NBC. Questions: No one has ever been charged in the murder of Paula Garrett, left, or the attack on her son Eric, when he was four. Her boyfriend was initially arrested but was freed after passing a lie detector test . Two months after the death, Green was arrested and charged with his girlfriend's murder, although he protested his innocence. His wife and children also stood by him. During a bond hearing, a neighbor testified that they saw Green rushing away from the home around 3am on the night of the murder. He underwent two polygraph tests, both of which he failed. But there were questions over how the tests were carried out so police took him to Chicago for a further test. After taking it, Green went to the restroom and escaped police custody. The next day, after it emerged he had passed the third test, police spoke to him on the phone and convinced him to turn himself in. He was taken back to Indiana where prosecutors dropped the charges - to the anger of police, The Star Press reported. Despite the decision, Eric's father, Robbie Garrett, said that his son maintained Green 'sent my mommy to heaven'. In 1981, the case was turned over to a countywide homicide investigation team after a grand jury decided the original probe was 'incomplete and one-sided'. The city later withdrew this decision. Prosecutor Michael Alexander told NBC that there was no specific evidence indicating Green was the killer. He suggested that the killing could have been motivated by a robbery or a sexual assault. Testimony: Neighbors said they often heard the young single mother, pictured with her son, arguing with her boyfriend, while one testified that he saw the boyfriend, Richard Green, near her apartment that night . 'I was pretty well convinced he didn't commit the crime based on evidence at the scene,' he said. 'I didn't like the idea of charging someone on phony evidence.' Police officers from the original case and members of Eric's family have since called for officials to reopen the case, and Delaware County Prosecutor Jeff Arnold said that he has met with Eric and has asked police to look for further leads. But right now there is no new evidence to bring charges, he said. After the attack, Eric, who was struck as many as 15 times with the blunt object, was left with partial paralysis on his right side and still has nine dimples on his head where his skull was fractured. He was raised by relatives and graduated high school. He still lives in the area with his dog. Green refused to speak with NBC and his daughter told reporters to stop contacting them.","Eric Garrett and his mother, Paula Garrett, 22, were beaten with a blunt object in their Indiana home in 1979 and she was killed .

Yusuf Mohamed Ismail Bari-Bari, Somalia's permanent representative to the United Nations in Geneva, Switzerland, was among those killed in the attack at the the Makka Al Mukarama hotel in Mogadishu, the Somali government said. The attack began around 5 p.m. when a car bomb exploded at the hotel's entrance, according to witness Aden Hussein, who said he was meters away from the hotel when the blast happened. Gunmen then went inside the hotel, shooting people, Hussein said. One of the attackers, wearing a belt with explosives, blew himself up inside the hotel, police Capt. Ahmed Abdi said . A few hours after the assault began, state-run media reported that security forces stormed the building and killed the remaining assailants. The attackers killed at least six people, Abdi said. The hotel, which is along a highway leading to the country's presidential palace, is popular with lawmakers, journalists and business people. An Al-Shabaab spokesman, Sheikh Abdiaziz Abu Musab, told CNN that the group was behind the attack. He said Al-Shabaab fighters were conducting an operation at the hotel against what he said were spies and government officials. Al-Shabaab has been active in Somalia for years. Initially its goal was implementing a stricter form of Islamic law, or Sharia, by warring against the Somali government. It has since shifted its focus to launching terror attacks in Somalia and beyond. Journalist Omar Nor reported from Mogadishu.

fc3033162487ad3d53455f05484730c55104c325,"Forty years after his death, a legal battle yesterday began to play out in a Jerusalem court over documents belonging to Oskar Schindler including personal copies of the lists of Jews he saved from the Holocaust. The case has been brought by Erika Rosenberg, an Argentinian woman, who is suing Jerusalem's Yad Vashem Holocaust museum over a suitcase containing thousands of Schindler's documents. The case sheds unusual light on Schindler's personal life after he saved some 1,200 Jews from the Nazis during World War II, and the battles over his estate. Visitors at the Yad Vashem Holocaust museum in Jerusalem walk past a portrait of Oskar Schindler, who saved some 1,200 Jews from the Nazis during World War II. Argentinian Erika Rosenberg is suing the museum over a suitcase containing thousands of Schindler's documents . An Ultra-Orthodox Jewish man looks at facsimiles of Oskar Schindler's lists displayed for the public at the Yad Vashem Holocaust memorial in Jerusalem, where the original documents are being stored in the museum's archives. The Yad Vashem Holocaust museum insists the documents it received in 1999 never belonged to Emilie Schindler, seen here during a 1993 ceremony for her late husband in Buenos Aires . Schindler's story captured public attention with Spielberg's 1993 Oscar-winning movie . Rosenberg claims ownership of the documents by virtue of being the heir of the German industrialist's late wife, Emilie. The suitcase and the documents have been held since 1999 by Yad Vashem, which insists they never belonged to Emilie Schindler but were passed on by Oskar Schindler to a third party before his death. During World War II, Schindler, an ethnic German from then-Czechoslovakia and a member of the Nazi party, persuaded German officers - through bribes and other means - to let him employ Jews at his factory, saving them from the death camps. His story captured public attention decades later with Steven Spielberg's 1993 Oscar-winning movie Schindler's List, with Liam Neeson playing the lead role. After the war, Schindler emigrated with his wife to Argentina, but in 1958 returned to Germany alone and died there in 1974. She remained his legal heir. The suitcase containing Schindler's personal documents and pictures - as well as a number of copies of the original lists of Jews he saved - eventually turned up in the home of a friend, the late Annemarie Staehr. In her lawsuit, Rosenberg describes Staehr as Schindler's 'lover' and claims she took it from his home after he died. But Yad Vashem's legal team says their relationship was platonic and that Schindler had given her the suitcase and its contents as a gift. According to the plaintiff, the suitcase was found at Staehr's house after she died and her children handed it over to a German newspaper and the German national archives in 1997. When news of the discovery became public, Emilie Schindler took legal action in Germany to retrieve the suitcase and its contents. But when a judge turned up to search the premises of the newspaper in 1999, he was told that they had already been sent to Yad Vashem, court documents show. In 2001, Emilie Schindler returned to Germany where she died, childless. In the last decade of her life, Emilie Schindler became close to Rosenberg, her biographer, and designated her as heir to her estate. Liam Neeson as Oskar Schindler in Spielberg's Oscar-winning movie . Holocaust survivor Solomon Susskind - who was saved by Oskar Schindler's list - places a flower at the Hall of Remembrance during a 2008 visit to the Yad Vashem Holocaust museum in Jerusalem . A woman looks at copies of facsimiles of Oskar Schindler's lists displayed at the Yad Vashem Holocaust memorial museum in Jerusalem . Yad Vashem claims that Rosenberg is a 'serial suer' who is seeking to exploit Schindler's memory for her personal gain. Documents related to Schindler have financial as well as historic value. In 2013, the blueprints for an expansion of his wartime factory in Poland were sold for $63,426 and the same buyer paid $59,135 for a 1944 letter of introduction signed by Schindler. None of the original lists of Jews comprising the 'Schindler lists' remain, but historians believe seven copies were made of them shortly after World War II. Only one such copy is currently in private hands. Every so often unsuccessful efforts are made to sell that document, most recently in 2013 with a starting price of $3 million. Naor Yair Maman, who represents Rosenberg, told AFP in March his client had tried to retrieve the documents informally for years, before finally resorting to legal action against Yad Vashem. 'I've no doubt that the issue of the ownership is very clear,' he told AFP. 'Even if you believe that from the historical-academic perspective, it would be preferable that the documents remain in Yad Vashem, you have no right, whatsoever, to claim title to someone else's property,' he said. Rosenberg doesn't say in the suit what she wants to do with the documents. Yad Vashem is a national institution which is tasked with gathering, examining and researching materials pertaining to The Holocaust. It is venerated within Israel and a mandatory stop on the itinerary of visiting dignitaries. The museum says the disputed documents 'belong in the public domain'. Yad Vashem insists it is legally entitled to the documents and has not acted in an underhand manner, denying claims by Rosenberg's legal team that it had 'grabbed' the suitcase. 'Yad Vashem holds the documents lawfully and has acted the whole time openly and publicly,' it said in a statement to AFP, in which it expressed opposition to 'trading in Holocaust-era documents'. 'We will hold our debate with Rosenberg in court to ensure these documents do not reach private hands, of those who are not their legal owners and whose interests are unclear,' it said.","The case has been brought by Erika Rosenberg, an Argentinian woman .

00cb273bbb4ea8011454a4df0d6f408b113d1709,"The EU is set to lift a ban on imports of chicken from the United States which are washed with a suspect acid disinfectant. American producers routinely wash raw chicken following slaughter with a substance called peroxyacetic acid (PAA) to remove harmful bacteria. The practice has been banned in Britain and Europe for many years because of a determination to remove harmful bugs at source, rather than using disinfectants to clean up carcasses. There are also concerns that reliance on these washes could put consumers at risk by playing a part in the creation of superbugs. However, the European Commission has signalled that it plans to lift the ban following pressure from the American government and US chicken producers. The EU has lifted a ban on U.S. chickens which are washed in an acid it is feared helps cause superbugs . The proposal has alarmed consumer groups, who say it is at odds with European policy, which has been designed to remove harmful bacteria from the birds on farms, rather than relying on disinfectants. Just last week, the chef and food campaigner, Jamie Oliver, warned that Britain and Europe risk importing inferior food from the USA under a new free trade deal called TTIP. Campaigners say the changes being planned to allow chicken washed with PAA are exactly the sort of thing that will become more common under the TTIP regime. Mute Schimpf, food campaigner for Friends of the Earth Europe, said: ‘The EU’s approach to food safety is under attack, even before any trade deal with the US is agreed. ‘Despite repeated denial from the EU and national governments, the pressure is increasing to allow more imports of factory farmed meat rinsed in disinfectants. The EU must take a clear stand and ban all imports of meat produced in this way, and show the public that it is not caving in to US trade interests.’ Celebrity chef Jamie Oliver has warned lowering standards risks allowing poor-quality US food into the British market . In the past, EU national governments have blocked moves by the European Commission to approve imports of ‘chlorinated chicken’ from the USA – chicken cleaned with a chlorine and water wash to kill bugs. This was done as a precaution and because it could mask poor hygiene standards, as well as harm the health of workers in abattoirs and lead to pollution. Consumer groups argue that these same safeguards should be applied to the use of PAA and imports of chicken cleaned with the disinfectant. The European consumer organisation BEUC insists that health and safety should be put ahead of a desire to improve trade relations with the US. It said: ‘As the EU and the US are engaged into talks for a free trade agreement, we look to EU authorities not to let their decision driven solely by trade considerations but to put food safety and consumer protection first.’ BEUC said allowing the use of these chemical treatments opens the door to lower hygiene standards on farms and in slaughterhouses. This is because producers may believe they can wash away any contaminants, rather than ensuring they are not there in the first place. It said: ‘We are concerned that PAA washes will not deliver any extra safety net. Rather, we see the risk they might be seen as a convenient substitute for good slaughter hygiene. ‘The availability of such treatment might lead slaughterhouse staff to be less vigilant on preventing carcass contamination to happen in the first place, hence putting consumers’ health at risk.’ The European Food Safety Authority has ruled that PAA is not toxic to humans, although it can trigger asthma and allergies in workers at processing plants where it is used. The death of a poultry inspector made the headlines in the US in 2013 and raised questions about the health risks associated with the use of chemical decontamination treatments of meat such as PAA. BEUC is also concerned that bugs might mutate and become immune to the chemicals used in the washing process, so getting through to the meat sold in supermarkets and restaurants. Consumer groups have said shoppers don't like the idea of their meat having been washed in chemicals . The group said there is also sound research showing shoppers do not like the idea of their chicken being treated with an acid wash. Research by the consumer group Which? in 2011 showed that 60 per cent of people were unlikely to buy chicken that had been sprayed or washed with a mild acid. The British Poultry Council said the UK and European tradition of trying to keep harmful bugs out of the food chain, from farm to fork, was better for the public than relying on chemical disinfectants. Chief executive, Andrew Large, said: ‘Chemical treatments should never be used as a substitute for good hygiene practice. 'EFSA has confirmed that peroxyacetic acid is safe to use in food production, but British poultry producers are not yet convinced its use is in the best interests of consumers compared to our farm-to-fork system.’","Food chiefs are to allow in chickens washed in peroxyacetic acid (PAA)

It will be offered at in London through the NHS and privately. The non-invasive IONA test examines DNA in cells from the foetus found floating in the mother’s blood and looks for evidence of chromosomal abnormalities that cause genetic disorders . Results will be given within days – compared to the two weeks it takes to send comparable tests abroad for processing. It is one of several non-invasive prenatal testing (NIPT) examinations that promise greater accuracy for women at high risk of having a Down’s baby. Eventually such NIPT tests will be routinely used to reassure all pregnant women. Current screening for Down’s on the NHS consists of the less-accurate ‘combined’ test, which uses ultrasound to measure the amount of fluid at the back of the baby’s neck at 11 weeks, as well as a blood test. Professor Basky Thilaganathan, consultant obstetrician at St George’s, said the new test was the first to be regulated under the EU’s health and safety standards. He said: ‘Too many pregnant women have been through the anxiety and discomfort of invasive procedures after receiving false positive results [women wrongly identified as being at risk] from the combined test – the IONA test gives us the accuracy and reliability to reduce this number significantly.’ Results will be given within days – compared to the two weeks it takes to send comparable tests abroad . A study by the UK National Screening Committee to check whether NIPT should be offered routinely on the NHS is underway, involving five hospitals, and is due to report later this year. Trials of another NIPT test offering expectant mothers 99 per cent accuracy in screening for Down’s syndrome are being run by Great Ormond Street Hospital. NIPT has a higher detection rate and lower false positive rate than the combined test. This means fewer women will undergo unnecessary invasive follow-up procedures which are stressful and carry a small risk of miscarriage. Dr Stephen Little, CEO of Premaitha – the makers of the IONA test, said: ‘We recognised the limitations in the current standard of prenatal screening and the huge unmet medical need for a regulated test.’","Non-invasive IONA test examines foetus DNA in cells in mother's blood .

Stefanovic was hit with a barrage of criticism when he asked a group of Indian fans at the Sydney Cricket Ground on Thursday 'who's going to be manning 7-Elevens today?'. The fan hilariously hit back saying 'you might have to look at Centrelink as well I think Karl' in terms of Australians at the World Cup match. The Channel Nine host offered a light-hearted apology on Friday morning before his co-hosts brought out an extremely hot Indian curry that left him sweating and watery-eyed. Scroll down for videos . Today show host Karl Stefanovic has been forced to eat a spicy curry as punishment after his '7-Eleven' sledge against a group of Indian cricket fans caused viewer backlash . 'I love India and I love the contribution Indians make in many different vocations across this great country. Our country is richer for having you and so are our sauces,' Stefanovic said as he gave his apology. 'Firstly to those members of the Indian community - our guest yesterday gave as good as he got and that banter continued in the true spirit of the world cup. 'After the show we had a great conversation. He owned me on air and off air. It was thought to be fun, it was fun, I enjoyed it and he enjoyed it. 'The comments were intended to be taken in the most light-hearted possible way. For anyone of you interpreting the comments in a different way my heartfelt apologies.' The Channel Nine host offered a light-hearted apology on Friday morning before his co hosts brought out an extremely hot Indian curry . The curry left Stefanovic with watery eyes and caused him to sweat on the breakfast television set . It came after an Indian fans (right) told Stefanovic he should be concerned as Centrelink would be empty of Australians as they all watch the cricket ahead of the semi-final match . Stefanovic then also offered an apology to New Zealanders after calling them 'dole bludgers', but continued to sledge fans at various times throughout the morning ahead of the match on Sunday. 'For my Kiwi brothers and sisters... calling you dole bludgers was an awful, cheap stereotype and just not true,' he said. 'As we all know you can't get the dole here in Australia. Again, my sincere, heartfelt apologies to anyone across the ditch or in Bondi who took offence. 'Just because you've got a cool, happening, effective government and a real attractive lot of livestock doesn't meant I should take the sheep out of you.' His remarks were met with sighs from the rest of his Today show host panel who said: 'This isn't going well'. Indian cricket fans were in full force at the Sydney cricket ground on Thursday as they took on Australia in the World Cup semi final . Today show host Karl Stefanovic made a light-hearted apology for his '7-Eleven' sledge to a group of Indian cricket fans saying Australia is 'richer for having you and so are our sauces' Stefanovic said the New Zealand fans had a bit to say on social media in relation to his comments and read out some of the complaints he had received. 'Obviously we were having a bit of banter about the cricket and I made some comments about New Zealand fans and a lot of you just aren't happy,' he said. 'We received thousands of comments about New Zealand and I'm surprised you can actually write.' The breakfast television host then read out some of the complaints sent in saying he was a 'twit' and a 'big mouthed d***head'. The interview that sparked the whole ordeal took place on Thursday morning outside the Sydney Cricket Ground when Stefanovic was sledging a group of Indian fans ahead of the semi-final match. The Indian fan's comeback caused an uproar of laughter in the Today Show studio, as Stefanovic said: 'What are you going to say to Warner?' Australian cricketer Dave Warner was famously fined 50 per cent of his match fee after he told Indian batsman Rohit Sharma to 'speak English' at the MCG in January. 'Look I'm not sure we can repeat that stuff on TV this early in the morning,' the India fan smiled. 'We'll definitely be right into him that's for sure. We'll definitely be speaking in English so he understands,' the India fan said. Viewers quickly reacted to Stefanovic's 7-Eleven question on social media, with some labelling it 'tasteless'. Karl Stefanovic asked a team of India supporters: 'Who’s going to be manning 7-Elevens today?' Andy Cussen asked: 'How does Karl Stefanovic still have a job? Complete muppet.' Megan Maurice said: 'You know, you just start to think that maybe Karl Stefanovic isn't that bad after all and then...' Angus Roberts described his comments as 'bit of a tasteless ""joke""'. And Paul Nolan said: 'I'm usually a fan of Karl Stefanovic but his 7-11 quip today was inappropriate and offensive.' Amber Monahan went as far as to call him 'an embarrassment to thinking Australians'. 'How dare you insult contributing members of Australia's economy. You sir are a fool. And Lisa Wilkinson guffawing in the background is hardly much better,' she said. However, Doovalacky Dave called Stefanovic's comments 'gold'.

She is best known as the society beauty who attended the same school as the Duchess of Cambridge and now organises sex parties for young actors and models. And now Emma Sayle, founder of the Killing Kittens parties is taking her events to New York City, it has been reported. Miss Sayle has been hosting the parties for the ‘sexual elite’ at secret, upmarket locations, which include discreet boutique hotels in Surrey, country estates in Berkshire and West Sussex, and luxury penthouses in London and LA. Those who hope to gain access must be aged between 18 and 45 and must either be a single girl or part of a couple. Applications are made via the Killing Kittens website and must be accompanied by a photograph. Now the New York Post has reported that the first Killing Kittens party will take place in a rented loft in Manhattan near to the Flatiron building on Saturday. It is thought around 60 people have already signed up to attend the party, including bankers and models. She told the newspaper: 'Statistically, New York is in our favour for it to work. 'It might help with all the frustration of all those women who can’t find men. They can come and share the men!' An event in Los Angeles is also set to take place at the weekend. Ms Sayle went to Downe House, the all-girls public school in Berkshire where Kate Middleton was also briefly a pupil. The entrepreneur then attended the University of Birmingham, where she first started organising parties and charities events. After graduating, she did a stint in the City before gravitating towards PR. It was then that she became acquainted with the sex-party industry. She also joined the Duchess in a dragon boat team called the Sisterhood for a charity race in 2007. Ms Sayle attended the same public girls school as the Duchess of Cambridge. They are pictured together in 2007 taking part in a dragon boat race for charity . Her first Killing Kittens event took place in Covent Garden, Central London, in 2005. Since then she has expanded the business across the UK, and has staged parties in the United States, with plans to host events in Australia and New Zealand. Speaking last year and referring to her UK Killing Kittens parties, which are aimed at those aged between 18 and 45, Ms Sayle said: ‘We've have had a few MPs and famous singers. 'We haven’t had any Royals yet but there have been a few A-list actors and actresses – but I couldn't reveal who.’ Last year, she also revealed how she had expanded her parties to cater for older people over the age of 45.

Only the good-looking are invited and they must be aged 45 or over. About 80 guests aged up to 60, wearing black tie or cocktail dresses, ate oysters and chocolates and sipped champagne before ‘retiring’ to candle-lit boudoirs. At the time she told the Mail on Sunday: 'Our first event went really well. The oldest person there was a guy aged 60, but he was in good shape. He had an air of confidence – sexiness comes down to confidence. ‘You can get a lot of stunning catwalk models in their 20s who are not confident. There’s nothing sexy about them.

f6021fea5682fc3de227dfdd30c31ddda8b445ac,"A former guard at Rikers Island who was convicted of smuggling drugs into the prison has revealed he helped female colleagues prostitute themselves to inmates and senior bosses. Ex-marine turned corrections officer Gary Heyward has made the explosive claims in his controversial memoir about his time as an employee at the notorious New York facility. The Bronx native describes how he would have a list of demands and orders when he arrived at work every day, but the illicit scheme earned him more money than his annual salary which started at $28,000. It included smuggling tobacco, drugs and cellphones to inmates and offering protection to three female prison guards who were selling sex. In the book he describes them as 'copstitutes'. Corruption officer: Gary Heyward, a former guard at Rikers Island, helped female officers prostitute themselves to inmates and jail bosses and later served time for running a huge smuggling operation at the prison . Before he got a job at the jail in 1996, he had served in Operation Desert Storm. His smuggling operation began when he saw a childhood friend, Biz, locked up on Rikers Island. He asked Heyward to pick up a carton of cigarettes which contained marijuana. According to the book titled Corruption Officer, an advanced copy of which was seen by the New York Daily News, the cigarette operation then skyrocketed. He would strap bags of tobacco to his body underneath his uniform to work and would sell $2 worth for around $200. For $500 he would also deliver burner phones to an inmate and would set higher prices for more specific orders - such as liquor, coke, cooch and, in one instance, red velvet cupcakes. However he changed the direction of his venture when a competitor started selling cocaine. He picked up half an ounce of the substance from the sister of his prison distributor, he describes in the book as Flocko, who then managed to make $1,500 in just 15 minutes. As the business grew a female correction officer, identified as Officer Rains, came to him and said she pouches for him if he  protected a the ring of three women who were prostituting themselves to inmates and other correction officers in return. Convicted: The corrections officer (pictured left in his uniform and right in a jumpsuit to promote his book) was jailed for two years in 2006 for selling drugs to inmates . Money: Heyward started working at the New York facility in 1996, starting on a basic annual salary of $28,000. In his book he describes how his illicit scheme made him more money . Rains then discovered Heyward's business had become widely known while she was sleeping with a high ranking security official in a hotel. He said to her during the encounter: 'If you want to get rid of all the drugs in the jail, get rid of Heyward.' His colleagues also started to notice he was friendly with some of the inmates - who they described as losers. Eventually he was busted during an undercover operation. Authorities installed recording devices in Flocko's sister's van and captured one of his drug deals. Heyward was sentenced  to two years in prison in 2006 after admitting to attempting to sell cocaine to an inmate and providing another with a cell phone for $500. In the book he says his behavior was driven by his need for money - as he had outstanding child support and a gambling problem. He wrote the book while behind bars in the upstate facility Oneida. Speaking to the Daily News, he said: 'I’m proof that once you serve your time you can go straight again. I live a respectable life now.' Corruption Officer is due for release on March 31 .

86156c7b9149916876d28d20a5ffb5d6bff7da79,"New pictures of killer co-pilot Andreas Lubitz as a smiling schoolboy have emerged - on the day Lufthansa Airlines admitted they knew six years ago that he suffered from a 'serious depressive episode'. The airline said that as part of its internal research it found emails Lubitz sent to the Lufthansa flight school in Bremen when he resumed his training there after an interruption of several months. In them he informed the school that he had suffered a 'serious depressive episode' which had since subsided. Scroll down for videos . Andreas Lubitz (pictured front row, seated left) in a class picture in 2002 with fellow pupils at the Mons-Tabor Gymnasium High School, in Montabaur, Germany - the picture is from a 2002 year book . Andreas Lubitz with class mates in 1999 at the Mons-Tabor Gymnasium High School in Montabaur, Germany. (He is pictured with curtain style haircut and squared patterned top) The airline said Lubitz subsequently passed all medical checks and that it has provided the documents to prosecutors. It declined to make any further comment today. Questions have been raised about what the airline knew about Lubitz's condition before last week's fatal crash. Authorities say the 27-year-old, who in the past had been treated for suicidal tendencies, locked his captain out of the cockpit before deliberately crashing the Airbus 320 into a mountain in the French Alps. Mons-Tabor Gymnasium High School in Montabaur, Germany, which Andreas Lubitz attended as a child . All 150 people aboard Flight 9525 from Barcelona to Duesseldorf were killed that day. Earlier today Lufthansa said it had set aside £203million to deal with possible costs from the March 24 crash. Meanwhile pictures of Lubitz at various ages while a pupil at Mons-Tabor Gymnasium High School in Montabaur, Germany, were released today - the same day it emerged Lubitz's girlfriend knew he had psychological issues.. Kathrin Goldbach reportedly told investigators she 'did not know the extent of the problems' despite her boyfriend seeing doctors a number of times in the months leading up to the disaster. Prosecutors said he had been treated for suicidal tendencies as a younger man and had been seen by doctors for depression on at least three occasions since February. He had also been to see an eye specialist over fears he was going blind, a condition that could have seen him stripped of his licence. The girlfriend of killer pilot Andreas Lubitz (above) knew he had psychological issues but the couple 'were optimistic' they could work through them, according to a source close to the investigation . Investigators are now increasingly certain this was the prime motive for his act of suicide and mass murder. But Miss Goldbach is said to be as shocked as anyone that his mental health problems would lead to him deliberately crashing his jet, killing all 150 people on board. A European government official close to the probe told CNN that Miss Goldbach knew he had seen two doctors - an eye consultant and a neuropsychologist - who both deemed him unfit for work. The eye doctor had diagnosed his failing eyesight as merely psychosomatic, the source added, confirming previous reports that the condition was not physical at all. He was given sick notes - found torn up at his home in Dusseldorf - and ordered by doctors to take time off work. But he feared this would increase his chances of being grounded, so he hid his sickness from his employers. Military vehicles arrive ahead of operations at the site of the Germanwings plane crash in Seyne-les-Alpes . Calling for change: Anneli Tiirik with her boyfriend Paul Bramley, who died in the Alps plane disaster . The grief-stricken girlfriend of a British student killed in the Alps plane disaster today called for tougher controls to weed out psychopathic pilots. At present, airlines carry out regular checks on their pilots, but this often just involves a brief chat with a doctor to assess their wellbeing. Anneli Tiirik, who is from Estonia, told MailOnline: 'Besides general physical, psychological and behavioural evaluation, another test should be added, I believe, to help avoid more deaths in the future. '(This should be) a neurological PET scan to discover and attentively observe psychopathic tendencies, so as to find out whether the subject is prone to violence and therefore not be given the extensive power that would most likely lead to harming other people. 'It is one thing to be suicidal or obsessive, but feeling no remorse or even nervousness when killing other human beings is a whole new level - a zone only real psychopaths can fully understand.' Ms Tiirik also called for laws to be relaxed to allow doctors greater freedoms to flag up patients with mental health problems if they are responsible for the live of others. German law meant it was left entirely up to Andreas Lubitz to volunteer his mental health problems to his employer, something he failed to do with devastating consequences after tearing up a sick note for the day of the crash. She said: 'I personally think that the problem doesn't lie in the management of the airline as much as in the general tendency of the society to be overly protective about people's medical data. 'It is visible to everyone if somebody has a serious physical illness, but when it comes to major mental problems, these are hidden away at any cost for fear of embarrassment or judgement. 'However, those are illnesses as well and should be treated and inspected accordingly, especially when it comes to job positions regarding huge responsibilities.' Her boyfriend, Paul Bramley, from Hull, was studying hospitality and hotel management in Lucerne, Switzerland, where he was about to start an internship after travelling with her. He had been to Barcelona after completing his first term of college for a few days' holiday with friends. Mr Bramley was flying back to the UK via Dusseldorf to see his family. By Richard Spillett . Passengers watch candles and flowers for the victims of the Germanwings plane crash at Dusseldorf airport . In a separate development, officials say it looks more and more likely that his primary motive for crashing the jet was due to his false fears about his failing eyesight. Bild newspaper, quoting a source close to the investigation, reported the official as saying: 'A main motive seems to be the fear that Lubitz had of losing his ability to fly because of medical problems.' Prosecutors hinted at this on Monday, but said trawls of his paperwork and computer files could not pin down a precise cause. However, there is speculation in Germany that the Germanwings marque may not survive the tsunami of lawsuits which are expected to be unleashed upon it. Strict German privacy laws which prevented doctors treating Andreas Lubitz from telling his airline about his 'suicidal tendencies' were introduced as a consequence of the Nazis. The Germanwings pilot had been forced to stop his training because of severe depression and had received psychotherapy for several years before last week's Alps disaster. But German law meant it was left entirely up to him to volunteer his mental health problems to his employer, something he failed to do with devastating consequences after tearing up a sick note for the day of the crash. The findings from the investigation have prompted heated debate in Germany on a patient's right to privacy, with Chancellor Angela Merkel proposing an inquiry to re-examine the law. Draconian legislation was initially brought in after World War Two to prevent a repeat of government spying during the Nazi era and subsequently the Stasi secret police in East Germany. This extends far beyond confidential medical data, however, to stringent protection of someone's identity, meaning many German publications only referred to Lubitz as Andreas L, even after his death. Further data protection laws traced back to 1907, which enshrines the 'right to your own picture', also mean images can only be published with the individual's consent. With respect to medical data, the criminal code means doctors are only allowed to breach confidentiality when they have reason to believe that sharing their knowledge could prevent 'a particularly serious crime' or a threat to someone's life. They can face a year in prison if they wrongly breach privacy, but up to five years in jail for withholding 'credible information about the planning or commission' of serious acts like murder. Despite the variation in sentences, doctors have tended to favour the individual's privacy. Many in Germany are now debating whether the potential to neutralise threats to public safety should trump doctor-patient privilege.","New pictures of killer co-pilot Andreas Lubitz as a schoolboy have emerged .

'I would describe her as soulless. She put her hand over his mouth and smothered him,' a police source told the New York Daily News.

A male employee performed CPR until paramedics arrived - despite the mother swatting help away. Unfortunately the aid was too late for the little boy who was later pronounced dead at Bellevue Hospital.

Previously director of sport at the London Olympics, she transformed England Rugby 2015. Debbie Jevans poses with the Wiliam Webb Ellis trophy during a World Cup media event in November 2012 . It is believed Jevans was exasperated with the old-boy network at the top of the Rugby Football Union, once described as ‘57 old farts’ by former England captain Will Carling, who had begun lining up to take credit for delivering a tournament that had been her ‘baby’.

ced2d3281aa1c7542efca0f03bb82ce78df04cf8,"London (CNN)Captive Ukrainian pilot Nadiya Savchenko has sent a stark message to Russian President Vladimir Putin as she awaits trial in a Moscow jail. In a letter from prison, written in response to questions from CNN, she said: ""If Putin wants to defeat Ukraine -- let's try to defeat me first!"" ""But if he wants peace and friendship between our nations as he claims,"" she added, ""I am ready to make the first step towards it. ""My freedom will be that first step towards peace and understanding in Ukraine."" Savchenko has been held by the Russian authorities in pre-trial detention since last June. Her defiant message was written after CNN submitted a series of questions to the Ukrainian fighter pilot through one of her lawyers, Mark Feygin. We do not know under what circumstances Savchenko answered the questions, but Feygin says she wrote the responses on Friday as he was visiting her. Savchenko undertook a hunger strike for 83 days to protest her detention despite pleas from her family and her lawyers. She recently abandoned her fast after nearing death but has since resumed it, only drinking broth and milk occasionally to stay alive. Russia claims the 33-year-old is behind the killings of two Russian journalists hit by mortar fire at a checkpoint in eastern Ukraine, allegations she has always denied. Moscow says she then crossed voluntarily into Russia and sought asylum as a refugee. The Ukrainian government, however, insists she was kidnapped by rebel forces and that she is a prisoner of war. ""I have already been in captivity for an hour when those Russian journalists died. I have not seen them, and our ways have never crossed.. The 'rebels' themselves told me that those journalists came under fire of their own 'makhnovtsi' [slang for 'anarchists'],"" Savchenko told CNN in her letter from jail. ""And the investigators knew all about it since the very beginning! And they have nothing on me! They simply thought that it would be easy to ""twist my arms"" and receive another star for their epaulettes. But it's not going to happen!"" she added. Savchenko's case has attracted wide international attention and turned her into a symbol of resistance against Russia in her home country, with Ukraine's President Petro Poroshenko awarding her the title ""Hero of Ukraine,"" one of the nation's highest honors. She has also been voted into the Ukrainian parliament despite her captivity. Despite her critical situation, Savchenko appears to have retained her sense of humor just as much as her determination, writing that she was feeling ""On the edge!...;) Close to Nirvana and enlightenment!;) Joking."" ""Holding on! But holding my body entirely on my the power of my will,"" she continued, ""because I am so numb that I couldn't feel the needle when the blood sample was taken from my vein today. ""Tottering, head is spinning, [blood] pressure 80x40, [blood] sugar 2.9, T [temperature] -- 35.7°C. But still be standing till 50kg [body weight]! Even longer if God let's me! Hasn't fainted even once and hasn't fallen off my feet."" The military pilot told CNN she is being monitored ""24 hours a day,"" which she finds ""very annoying."" ""Protection and security measures are such that King Kong would not have been able to break away!;),"" she joked again. ""But in general all is very decent and polite! Treatment is reasonable."" Savchenko's lawyer recently told CNN's Christiane Amanpour in an interview that President Putin holds Savchenko's fate and that she wanted to await trial out of jail. Several international dignitaries have urged Moscow to release her, including EU Foreign Policy Chief Federica Mogherini and the U.S. State Department, to no avail. But as Savchenko continues her hunger strike, is she willing to ultimately die in detention? ""To die?! That's not our methods!!!;) I'll think of something better!...:;),"" she said. ""I'll be on hunger strike as I said until I am returned back to Ukraine, or at least [until] detention is changed to a house arrest at the Ukrainian Consulate in RF, which is actually a part of Ukraine in Russia. ""There is no point starting eating in prison. The bite doesn't go down the throat here in this cage! And the truth must win after all!!!"" CNN reached out to Russian authorities for an update on Savchenko's case, who referred us to their last statement on Savchenko, dated from 20 February, where they call on the media to ""Let the investigators to finish their job. Let the court of justice to determine Savchenko's degree of guilt of and punishment for the crimes she is charged with."" Savchenko is currently scheduled to appear in court on May 13.","Captive Ukrainian pilot sends message to Putin as she awaits trial in a Moscow jail .

12045fd7b4997e27763da9eec39798ee1a4d0299,"David Cotterill has revealed the first battle for him and Wales captain Ashley Williams ahead of their crunch Euro 2016 qualifier in Israel will just be getting off the ground. Both the Birmingham City winger and the Swansea captain have a fear of flying so will look to each other for support when the Welsh squad head to the skies on Thursday. Belgium’s match in Israel originally scheduled for last September was postponed until this month because of the Gaza conflict. But simply being 30,000 feet high will be of concern to Cotterill. Swansea and Wales defender Ashley Williams has a fear of flying . He laughed: ‘I’m a nervous wreck on every flight I go on, it doesn’t matter where it’s to. Normally when I’m flying I grab my two children’s hands. ‘When I’m on my own, Ashley Williams is across from me and he’s a nervous flier too, we just look at each other like we’re having a panic attack. ‘He’s a warrior on the pitch but when it comes to flying he’s a little baby.’ Cotterill has played an important part in Wales travelling to the Middle East with designs on topping their Euro 2016 qualifying group on departure. The 27-year-old came off the bench in the win over Cyprus earlier in the campaign to score a long-range free-kick, before starting the goalless draw in Belgium. ‘It was an amazing result for us. In previous years we would probably have gone over there and got beaten three or four nil,’ he told Sportsmail. Swansea defender Williams regarded as a fearless competitor on the pitch . ‘I think the squad has improved so much, and we have great confidence. Hopefully we can do something special by qualifying.’ Wales have not made a major tournament since the 1958 World Cup but sit second in Group B on eight points, one behind Israel having played a game more. Belgium are fourth on five points with a game in hand on Wales. Cotterill made his debut a decade ago as a 17-year-old, coming on to replace Ryan Giggs, so is well placed to chart the strides taken by this Wales team and how Gareth Bale has grown in dressing room stature. ‘We have great experience, he said. ‘Baley, Rambo (Aaron Ramsey) and (Chris) Gunter have a lot of caps for their age, obviously brought through from the days of (John) Toshack and (Gary) Speed. ‘A lot of us have been together for many years and that’s only benefitting us now. The group is a lot closer now than in previous years and it’s showing on the pitch.’ He added: ‘Baley’s signed for Real Madrid and he is one of our leaders. He does speak a lot more than he used to. Whatever he says he’s talking sense because he’s playing for one of the best managers in the world. He knows his stuff.’ Bale’s presence, despite his difficult spell at Real, encourages Cotterill to believe Wales can beat Israel, who have a perfect record so far. Birmingham winger David Cotterill (centre) will be part of the Wales squad flying to Israel . ‘We’ve got one of the best players in the world, if that doesn’t give you a lift nothing will. Most of our starting XI are in the Premier League playing week in week out. Our core is quality. We show respect but we have nothing to fear.’ Cotterill has enjoyed a bright season at Birmingham, revived under Gary Rowett, having moved from Doncaster last summer. He has eight goals from the right wing and seven assists, numbers that compete with any players in is position in the Championship. ‘I’m happy the way the season has gone, I’m hoping to score more goals and get to the double figure mark, hopeful add a few more assists,’ he said. ‘Then I could look back at a successful season.’","Ashley Williams and David Cotterill both have a fear of flying .

848747976d10a32fe7783058550812d1c182b316,"Stars of the MTV reality shows, 16 & Pregnant and Teen Mom, Catelynn Lowell and Tyler Baltierra, shared their teen pregnancy on television and had a baby, Carly, they placed for adoption. But their personal life before their reality show fame was mired in violence, drugs and sexual abuse. The Teen Mom couple announced their engagement in December after Tyler surprised his sweetheart with an diamond engagement ring. Days later, Catelynn gave birth to their second child, Nova Reign. Their first child, Carly, now five, was given up for adoption when they were 16. Besides telling their story, the reformed couple offer wayward teenagers advice on growing up and 'breaking the cycle of dysfunction' in a new book, Conquering Chaos, published by Post Hill Press. Both Tyler, 24, and Catelynn, who turns 24 on March 12, grew up in different trailer parks in Port Huron, Michigan, but they both experienced the trailer park trash life of intoxicated parents deep into drug abuse, parental jail time and violence. Scroll down for video . Catelynn Lowell and fiancée Tyler Baltierra have been open about her mother and his father's battle with addiction. But they've never revealed the hell they experienced as children as a result or the terrifying habits their parents passed onto them. In their new memoir, Conquering Chaos, the Teen Mom fan-favorites, both 23, talk about witnessing drug-related gun fights, abusing ecstasy and cocaine and more . Out of control. Catelynn and Tyler admit they didn't give birth control much thought. They were using the pull-out method, and that was it. 'I didn't wear condoms and Cate never went on birth control,' writes Tyler. The Teen Mom and her boyfriend decided to give their baby up for adoption . Oh so innocent: Catelynn's mother was a drunk often passed out on the floor, her father an alcoholic and crack addict who spent most of his time in jail. Tyler  became a daycare delinquent at age five and was drinking, smoking weed and cigarettes and taking drugs by age eight . Catelynn says her mother was 'a b****' and a drunk often passed out on the floor, her father an alcoholic and crack addict who spent most of his time in jail. 'It was chaos all the time. I didn't like it, and I didn't thrive on it, but I was familiar with it. It was normal to me,' Catelynn writes. Tyler's father was a crack addict, a con artist, who spent most of his son's younger years in jail while his supportive mother cycled through boyfriends. So the little boy became a daycare delinquent at age five and was drinking, smoking week and cigarettes and taking drugs by age eight. The young couple fell in love at age twelve and 'we both ended up on the same wild ride'. 'Our decision to have sex — and the way we handled it — brought about a consequence that changed our lives forever.' The as-yet-unmarried childhood sweethearts had their second child, Nova on January 1 this year that they are raising, and decided to write about life before the cameras were rolling when they were terrified teenagers mired in the most extreme dysfunctional families in a seedy environment. Catelynn viewed herself as a social butterfly and opted for multiple boyfriends over passing grades in school although school helped her forget how miserable life was back at the trailer. Tyler spotted her when they were both in junior high, walked up and just took her hand. 'We just walked on ahead, holding hands, and we've been together ever since', he writes. 'Her smile lights up the room and her eyes are beautiful piercing gray. Plus, she's got bigger t**s than any other girl in the seventh grade. 'Definitely my kind of chick. I think to myself, ""I have to have her."" He wrote her funny notes, cracked jokes, clowned around. He was more open than she was and he taught her to state her own opinions after years of smothering them and lying. 'So speaking my mind and sharing my feelings just wasn't at the top of my list of survival skills. It wasn't something that had gotten positive results in the past. Blowing smoke: Catelynn Lowell smokes on a bong at a gathering with friends in August 2012 . Baby joy: Catelynn gave birth to their second child, Nova Reign in January, days after they got engaged . 'For my whole life, I had a habit of telling people what I thought they wanted to hear, even if it wasn't the truth'. But they didn't start sleeping together until ten months later. Tyler was molested by an older girl, a friend of his older sister, when he was nine years old. 'One day I went over to her house with my sister and some other people, and for some reason or another, everyone else left but this older girl and me. For the next several hours, while we were alone together in her house, it was sex act after sex act after sex act. It went on all day. She had us doing everything she could think of, one thing after another. There'd be a break and then it would start up again. And when it was finally over, I didn't know what the hell had happened'. That incident left him wanting sex from girls who were only ten years old and if they didn't put out, he called them prudes and broke up with them. When Cate finally gave in to Tyler's sexual desires, it was gangbusters – 'banging in his mom's trailer'. 'Once we'd done it once, we were doing it all the time! After waiting so long we turned into crazy, horny teenagers. It was so bad,' she says. 'We would drink and party together and fool around constantly, all the time'. 'Unfortunately, we were not being safe at all', Tyler says. 'We were using the pull-out method, and that was it. I didn't wear condoms and Cate never went on birth control. 'We just didn't feel like we had to. My parents hadn't given me a real talk about it yet, and Cate's parents hadn't given her a talk. We went through sex education and everything, but I sort of thought I was an expert already. We are family: 'Nothing better than getting to spend the day with both of these amazing woman... my sister and my mother... family is EVERYTHING!,' Tyler posted on Instagram . 'We thought pulling out is good enough, and like typical dumb kids, we couldn't actually comprehend what would happen if it wasn't. 'We just approached sex like we'd taken the pills and the air duster. It was fun and it was available, so we did it, because the risks didn't really scare us. We were doing adult things with a child's level of understanding'. They were also consuming big quantities of drugs. He was smoking cigarettes and weed and drinking booze at age eight as well as 'huffin' air duster that he had stolen from CVS that make his head turn into a balloon. It caused him to have a seizure and pee all over himself. She smelled pot in her house at age ten and started getting high on the sleeping pill Unisom to trip out hallucinating, consuming five or six at a time. She snorted Ritalin – or anything else that happened to be around. 'And there was Robotrippin', where we chugged a bunch of cough syrup to get high. We did Ecstasy when we had that. Basically, anything we could get our hands on to get high with, we'd do it. 'I was a little behind on the air duster. I watched my friends do it for about a month, but I was kind of scared of it. But then I got curious to see what the big deal was, so I started doing that, too. 'We never really drank much, funny enough. We did everything else we could get, huffin', snorting pills, smoking weed, we were all about that stuff. But even our friends weren't really drinking. Why drink when you can huff air duster?' – was her thought. Happy reunion: Catelynn and Tyler's reunion with their biological daughter was filled with joy, smiles and plenty of happy tears . She was just trekking down the same drug route that generations of her relatives had traveled for years. He was in the same boat. 'It would have been better not to mess around with air duster and snort cocaine in middle school. No doubt about that', she says. 'And we can never be certain how long that phase would have lasted, if it wasn't for one little thing. Once that pregnancy test came back positive, there was no more room for drugs and alcohol in our lives. 'We dropped that stuff and didn't even have time to look back.' The teen pregnancy saved their lives from falling further into drug abuse. Now the couple are pursuing healthy, positive lives and hope to encourage teenagers in trouble with self-esteem issues or in unhealthy relationships to seek out counseling to learn self-worth. 'I put my life out there to help others', Catelynn writes. 'For the kids growing up in trailer parks, unstable homes or in the shadow of family problems and addiction – . 'Single moms. 'Pregnant teens feeling lost and scared. 'Anyone trapped in a cycle of dysfunction and wants to make something better of their lives—whatever encouragement we can offer, we offer it from the bottom of our hearts'.

6f5f0affb540dee4c5562ab330857c3caa7fe1ed,"Former Liverpool winger John Barnes has warned Raheem Sterling about setting his ambitions too high, too soon. The 20-year-old is currently locked in contract negotiations with the Reds after rejecting what manager Brendan Rodgers described as an 'incredible' offer, reportedly £100,000-a-week. His current deal is not due to expire until 2017 but the current impasse in talks - which will not resume until the end of the season - has led the youngster to be linked with a number of Europe's top clubs. There has been much speculation over the future of Liverpool youngster Raheem Sterling (centre) Sterling, who is currently on international duty with England, is in the process of negotiating a new contract . Barnes believes it would be a mistake, however, for Sterling to go looking for a multi-million pound move before he has properly proved himself. 'I would advise any young player who has been in the game for one or one and half years to stay and learn his trade,' he told talkSPORT. 'Show consistency over a four or five-year period before you make a big move, because then he will be judged as a £50million player. 'I don't think he is ready for a move to Real Madrid, Barcelona or Manchester City. Talks have finished until the end of the season, but there has been speculation over a big-money move abroad . Former Liverpool winger John Barnes believes that Sterling should stay and learn his trade at Anfield . 'As a Liverpool fan I want him to stay but I think himself he needs to be very careful. 'Unfortunately the bad advice often sounds the most lucrative and therefore the best advice. 'Has he been playing consistently well over a long time? No he hasn't, and maybe his form has suffered because of the whole situation about that (contract).' Barnes said recent history is littered with examples of poor decisions and failures by young players and he did not want Sterling to make the same mistake. 'We saw it with Scott Sinclair and Jack Rodwell, who both went to Man City. Where are they now?' he added. 'I think any young player should show a level of consistency where you are happy and people accept you and then if you want to put yourself under pressure by making a big money move do that - because it can all go wrong. Sterling needs to show consistency over a four or five-year period to warrant a big move, according to Barnes . Barnes noted that Sterling should not make the same mistake as Scott Sinclair, who moved prematurely . 'I think [he needs] another two or three years at Liverpool and if he then decides he wants to move on then fine.' While Sterling is still trying to establish himself as one of Liverpool's top players, one of their very best - Steven Gerrard - will be leaving in the summer to join Los Angeles Galaxy. There have been suggestions the Reds captain's legacy has been tarnished somewhat by his senseless sending-off against Manchester United last Sunday, coming a year after his slip against Chelsea played a huge part in the club missing out on the title. Barnes, however, dismissed such talk. 'Steven Gerrard and Kenny Dalglish are the two greatest players for Liverpool,' he said. 'Nothing has changed because he got sent off against Manchester United and nothing will change in the rest for the season.'","Raheem Sterling has been linked with a move away from Liverpool .

The wholesale price of diesel is 1p a litre more than for petrol, yet diesel is almost 6p more at the pumps, it said. There is scope for a diesel price cut of around 4p a litre to restore some parity to the market, the RAC added. The automotive company calls out retailers, saying businesses in particular are paying excessive charges on Diesel as sales of the fuel increase . The RAC’s comments came as it highlighted Government figures which showed total fuel sales were up 3.5 per cent in February compared with the same month last year. Diesel sales last month, at 2.42billion litres, represented the fifth highest monthly total since 1990. But petrol sales are among their lowest for 25 years. Businesses, which are more likely to run on Diesel are being ripped off by retailers who are looking to offset losses from low petrol prices . Because companies traditionally run on diesel, they are particularly hard hit by the fuel rip-off. RAC spokesman Simon Williams said: ‘It’s hard not to think that business is being taken for a ride. 'With sales of diesel at an all-time high the retailers have maintained a higher margin on diesel, perhaps to subsidise petrol sales.’","RAC says individuals and business paying unfair charges on diesel .

0c2c9f7be3be62400a13e762c8e82eff0684a111,"An ex-girlfriend of former U.S. Representative Michael Grimm who had pleaded guilty to raising illegal campaign money for the New York politician was sentenced on Tuesday to three months in custody. The sentence for Diana Durand, 48, was unexpected because prosecutors had not recommended anything more than probation. The punishment could foreshadow a prison term for Grimm, who pleaded guilty in December to tax felony evasion. He is scheduled to be sentenced by a separate judge in June. Diana Durand, who had pleaded guilty to raising illegal campaign money for two congressional candidates, was sentenced on Tuesday to three months in custody. The punishment was unexpected because prosecutors had not recommended anything more than probation . Durand pleaded guilty in September to violating the Federal Election Campaign Act by directing more than $10,000 in campaign contributions to two candidates for the House of Representatives in 2010 through straw donors whom she reimbursed, avoiding federal caps on donations. Her attorney Stuart Kaplan, who is also Grimm's attorney, has confirmed that one of the two candidates was Grimm, with whom she at one time had a personal relationship. Kaplan claimed last May that Durand did not intend to commit a crime and that she was being targeted solely because of her ties to Grimm. 'My client is not a sophisticated woman,' he said, explaining that she did know what she was doing was illegal. ‘She was just trying to help this guy out who she was in a relationship with – nothing more, nothing less,’ he said at another point in April. But in September she copped to the charges for which she was sentenced today. It was not immediately clear whether Durand would serve the three months in jail or in a halfway house. U.S. District Judge Sterling Johnson of Brooklyn also ordered Durand to pay a $10,000 fine. She faced up to eight years in prison and a maximum $600,000 fine. Nevertheless, Kaplan said after the hearing he was shocked by the sentence and that he would ask the judge to reconsider. 'This is clearly, to me, a miscarriage of justice,' he said. Grimm is seen here following his guilty plea at the Brooklyn federal court in New York on December 23, 2014 to a tax evasion charge related to a Manhattan health food restaurant he partly owned, Healthalicious. He resigned and formally left office several days later . Durand lives in Houston, where she works as a manager for an oil distributor. She is also a single mother. Grimm, who represented New York City's borough of Staten Island and part of Brooklyn, was elected in 2010. He announced his resignation in December - just a month after winning reelection on the grounds that he was innocent - after first saying he would stay on the job, even after he had pleaded guilty to the tax evasion charge related to a Manhattan health food restaurant he partly owned, Healthalicious. He then made an about-face and left Congress as the new session began on Jan. 5. He had been indicted on 20 counts of fraud, perjury and conspiracy after a federal probe of his fundraising. Prosecutors in that case suggested that judge Pamela K. Chen sentence Grimm to between 24 to 30 months in prison. Kaplan, a former colleague of Grimm's at the Federal Bureau of Investigation, and his associates recommended 12 to 18 months.","The sentence for Diana Durand, 48, was unexpected because prosecutors had not recommended anything more than probation .

I have a dream job and I live in my dream house. I live with my dream girl. I'm a happy guy."" It's no wonder Pelz is content. His named is etched in the evolution of golf. His students, including five-time major champion Phil Mickelson, have amassed a combined 20 majors between them and as one of golf's most fertile brains, Pelz has 26 golf patents to his name. The 70-year-old still works with Mickelson prior to major tournaments and the player known as ""Lefty""credits Pelz with helping to elevate his game to the elite level. ""I was 0-for-43 in majors before I met him, and I've won four, plus a Players Championship since,"" Mickelson was quoted as saying prior to capturing his fifth major -- the British Open -- in 2013. ""That says it all about him, in my book."" The septuagenarian pioneered the use of statistics back in the 1970s and 80s, his analysis of the game sculpted by a 15-year stint working for space agency NASA. His insistence on short game practice, and invention of clubs to help players hone their skills in that department, have informed the modern professional's approach. ""I did space research and golf research on my own time,"" explained the brains behind the two-ball putter, one of the best-selling clubs of all time that helped golfers line up their putts more accurately. ""NASA has the most unbelievable equipment in the world and that was the dawn of the space race. Sputnik had just gone up. ""We were trying to catch the Russians in terms of space exploration. And I got in a wonderful group of scientists and learned to do honest to God research."" Pelz banked a place at Indiana University thanks to a golf scholarship and chose to study physics. He famously played the legendary Jack Nicklaus 22 times and lost to the 18-time major champion on every occasion, but made significant improvements to his game once he began working for NASA. Using the one variable at a time method favored by scientists, Pelz began grading his own performance using the methods he'd picked up at the Goddard Space Flight Center. And gradually, piece by piece, he began to deconstruct each facet of his game and isolate the improvements he needed to make. ""I started measuring my own putting,"" he said. ""I started measuring my short game. I started measuring my driving. ""I learned how to measure things at Goddard Space Flight Center because they had the best instruments in the world and I learned the practical application of the scientific method. ""I finally started understanding my game after 10 years of research. It's funny to say from a person who went to college for four years on a golf scholarship. ""Those thousand lessons that taught me virtually nothing ... they might not have been teaching right but it was also partly I wasn't listening and I wasn't looking for the things that I needed to look for. ""All of a sudden I qualified again for the U.S. Amateur (America's leading competition for amateur golfers) and I'm not practicing at all like I used to but my game was better. I was a better player."" Despite this spike in quality, Pelz was still hesitant when it came to the prospect of throwing his lot in on the PGA Tour with other professionals. ""I had a serious thinking period,"" he explained. ""And I thought the game really doesn't need another good player. ""I believed by now that if I really worked hard I could be a really good player and I might be able to make it on the Tour, but I'd never be the best player in the world. ""I didn't have that kind of practice time in me. At this stage I'm 35 now and I got so involved in the research of golf, in finding out about my own game, I thought 'I could help a lot of players.' ""What the world really needs is for somebody to tell them what they're doing wrong so they can score better and enjoy the game more. ""That's really what golf is about. It's really not what you shoot, it's whether or not you are improving."" While Pelz's brain power is not in question, his business acumen is -- by his own admission. After taking a year-long leave of absence from Goddard and securing funding from a group of friends, he embarked on a journey that would eventually lead to his space age backyard in Austin. But it was a bumpy ride to say the least. ""I'm a terrible businessman to this day,"" he joked. ""I don't do anything in my company except teach golf and do golf research. My wife is the CEO. She runs the company and makes all the decisions. Of that first year in business he recalls: ""I spent all the money and lost every dime. And they said 'Well, here's some more.' I lost that the second year. ""Then they said: 'We're out. That's all the money we have. We're not going throw money down a rat hole. You don't know what you're doing in business.' Which is true, I did not."" However, by this time Pelz had hit upon the idea that would help him make an indelible mark on golf -- the importance of the short game. After three years studying players on the PGA Tour he deduced they were neglecting one of the most important areas of the game -- from 100 yards in. His calculations underlined the short game accounted for as much as 65% of golf, and also happened to be the one area in which most professionals struggled. Most players had a range of clubs that essentially fulfilled the same function -- to hit the ball long distances -- while they relied on just one club to take care of business from 100 yards out or closer. Pelz said: ""Thirty five years ago nobody even talked about short game -- the term wasn't used. It was golf. ""When I was taught golf I was taught that it was a drive and a shot to the green and then you putted. ""But if you can't get to the green you can't play golf so everybody practices the long game and they didn't even call it the long game. That was just the game. ""But I did my research and I measured how many shots people hit and it turns out everybody does hit the first two shots. ""They hit the ball off the tee, then they hit the ball at the green -- most people miss the green -- then they hit a chip shot or a pitch shot, sometimes it's not very good and they do another one and then two or three putts. ""So the truth is there are two long shots and three or four or five short game shots every hole and people don't think about these. They just think it looks like it's easy to do. ""It is easy to do if you know how to do it but it's not easy to do right if you don't know how to do it and you never practice it. ""If all you practice is the long game, practicing that for the rest of your life will not help your short game because they take different swings. They are truly different games."" Pelz's breakthrough came just at the right time. With money running out he had mortgaged his house, resigned from his role with NASA and was relying on the players he was working with to fund his fledgling start-up. At year five he had reached break even point, and would continue to do so until year 21, when he finally started making money. By this time his portfolio of players was ever expanding, and grew to include Mickelson, widely regarded as one of the finest short game exponents ever. ""I've worked with over 100 players now on the tour and Phil Mickelson and everybody says, 'oh he has a natural god-given talent with a short game,"" Pelz said. ""No he's not. He's very talented but he also works very hard. He has practiced and practiced and tested and experimented."" The pair still work together, but it is often missed by the mainstream media as they tend to meet two weeks out from a major tournament. Pelz is still as enthusiastic about golf as he ever was, especially about the dynamics of the short game and how important it is to keep practicing. While some players will never be able to match the game's power hitters no matter how hard they train, short game is one area pros and amateurs can make huge strides in. ""I will never hit it as far as Rory McIlroy,"" Pelz said. ""I can't do it. Now you give me that kind of (extensive) practice and I will kill him in the short game and putting. ""That's saying a lot because he's good at short game and putting. He's not bad but he's not practicing it 12 hours a day, every day, seven days a week. ""So I'm saying no matter what you do you'll never conquer the full power game as much as you can conquer the short game and putting for amateurs. I think there's a lot of potential for amateurs. ""I want them to focus there and enjoy the game more.""","Renowned short game coach Dave Pelz has turned his backyard into a golf paradise .

f61e3589b585111436ca658b1a4aee4b9e1b6996,"Los Angeles (CNN)Gov. Jerry Brown unveiled an emergency $1 billion spending plan Thursday to tackle the state's historic drought. A staggering 11 trillion gallons are needed for California to recover from the emergency. Senate President pro Tempore Kevin de León said the legislation will include two bills that will speed up contracting funds to ""manage the drought and strengthen our infrastructure."" According to the California State Water Resources Control Board, the package will specifically accelerate $128 million from the governor's budget to provide direct assistance to workers and affected communities. Proposition 1 funding, which enacted the Water Quality, Supply, and Infrastructure Improvement Act of 2014, will funnel $272 million into safe drinking water efforts and maintenance of water recycling infrastructure. Some $660 million from Prop 1 will also be accelerated for flood protection in urban and rural areas. As part of the changes, Brown said additional measures will crack down on water inefficiency as California enters the fourth year of a worsening-water crisis. ""This unprecedented drought continues with no signs yet of letting up,"" said Brown. ""But we have a lot of good policies coming."" To exacerbate matters, weather conditions are continuing to diminish natural resources. The Sierra Nevada snowpack, which Californians rely on heavily during the summer for their water needs, is at a near record low. The March snowpack measurement came in at 0.9 inches of water content in the snow, just 5% of the March 3 historical average for the measurement site. The overall water content for the Northern Sierra snowpack came in at 4.4 inches, just 16% of average for the date. Central and southern Sierra readings were 5.5 inches (20% of average) and 5 inches (22% of average) respectively. Only in 1991 has the water content of the snow been lower. ""The drought isn't letting up, so we can't let up either,"" Assembly Speaker Toni Atkins said. ""This legislation will deliver relief to Californians harmed by the drought and help us manage the significant problems the drought continues to cause. Since our skies are still clear, our job is too. And making sure we meet emergency needs, prepare for short term problems and advance longer-term projects are an important part of that effort."" Brown anticipates his emergency package to move into action immediately. He has recently created a Drought Task Force to expedite the legislation.","Gov. Jerry Brown: ""This unprecedented drought continues with no signs yet of letting up""

cd849e0eed77aeacd174053ec0621f4bd3aa6e9c,"(CNN)What does it take to help a single dolphin entangled in fishing line? In the recent case of a dolphin calf rescued off the eastern coast of Florida, about two days of effort involving seven boats and 35 people from 12 institutions and organizations. And that was after four weeks spent finding him and evaluating his situation to see whether it warranted intervention. With spring approaching, marine experts say it's a good reminder to look after your belongings when you take to the water. From plastic bags to swimming trunks to crab pots, marine life can get entangled in all manner of human debris. With limited time and resources, experts can't save them all. ""You really want to make sure you keep all your hands on your stuff,"" said Elizabeth Stratton, National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration Fisheries' assistant marine mammal stranding coordinator for the southeast region. ""We feel a special responsibility in cases where an animal's health is in danger because of debris introduced by humans,"" said Stratton, who was involved in last week's rescue. So where does an intervention begin? A couple spotted the calf off the coast of Fort Pierce with monofilament line wrapped around his rostrum, or snout. The mammal was riding the wake of their boat. They reported it January 18 to the Harbor Branch Oceanographic Institution, which set out to find the calf and his mother. The group found the pair and took more pictures, which were sent to the NOAA Fisheries on February 9 for evaluation. The photos revealed monofilament line wrapped around the calf's upper jaw, cutting into the tissue to the bone, threatening his ability to eat or possibly leading to infection. Veterinarians who reviewed the photos deemed the injuries potentially life-threatening. ""We can't disentangle every animal,"" Stratton said, ""but If it comes back as life-threatening, we mobilize to do disentanglement."" The next step was to find the creatures again. Through characteristics on the mother's dorsal fin, the group was able to identify her through records on file and target her home range for a search. After a two-day search, the group found the dolphins on Friday and approached for intervention. The process took about an hour, from netting the calf and his mother to sending them on their way, Stratton said. Apart from the fishing line both mother and son were in good condition. Rescuers gave the calf a long-lasting antibiotic and radio-tagged the mother before releasing them to the ocean ""where they belong,"" Stratton said. The moral of the story for humans: ""Be conscious of your gear."" To report an injured marine mammal, call 877-WHALEHELP (877-942-5343).","It took about four weeks and an hour for rescuers to help a dolphin calf .

Jonathon Keats, a conceptual artist and journalist, plans to capture the world's longest photo exposure, PetaPixel reports. A camera filled with oil paint instead of photographic film will capture the 1,000-year-long exposure of Tempe, Arizona. Keats calls this and similar creations 'deep time cameras.' Exposure: Jonathon Keats (photographed), a conceptual artist and journalist, plans to capture the world's longest photo exposure, a 1,000-year-long exposure of Tempe, Arizona . The camera, with a 24-karat gold plate on its front, will be installed three feet above ground at the Arizona State University Art Museum's sculpture garden trellis after it is unveiled Friday at the museum. The camera will be pointed at the city's skyline, capturing how civilization changes over the next 1,000 years. Over time, the color in the paint will fade where the light enters the camera the brightest, slowly -- very slowly -- creating an image of the Tempe skyline in red and white. The experiment will be finished in spring 3015 and the museum will hold a month-long exhibit when the project is complete -- if everything goes according to plan in the next 1,000 years, of course, Slate reports. 'The first people to see this picture will be children who haven't yet been conceived,' Keats told PetaPixel. 'They're impacted by every choice we make, but they're powerless. If they can't influence our decisions, at least they can bear witness.' Camera: The camera, with a 24-karat gold plate on its front, will be installed three feet above ground at the Arizona State University Art Museum's sculpture garden trellis after it is unveiled Friday at the museum . This experiment will be one Keats won't live to see, neither will his children, nor his children's children, nor his children's children's child- okay, you get the point. But Keats told PetaPixel that he doesn't mind being not being able to attend the exposure's unveiling in 3015. 'I'll be dead,' Keats said. 'But I don't regret it at all. For me, it's much more interesting to be here today, seeing the behavior of people who know they're being watched by the unborn, and also to be watched myself, living vicariously as a future memory of the next millennium.' Keats told Slate that the resulting photos won't be confusing, but will require a bit of interpretation to deconstruct what is recorded in the photo. Skyline: The camera will be pointed at the city's skyline (photographed), capturing how civilization changes over the next 1,000 years . He told PetaPixel that the photograph will not only show Tempe's skyline, but will illustrate how it develops over time. 'For instance, old houses torn down after a couple centuries will show up only faintly, as if they were ghosts haunting the skyscrapers that replace them,' Keats said. Keats told Slate that he can't guarantee that the picture will be perfect or even perceptible. In fact, he said, it may take multiple attempts to get the exposure just right -- that could take thousands of years. But he said he does not see that as a fault. 'A total failure photographically could still be a success conceptually,' he said. Keats said he chose Tempe because it is representative of urban expansion throughout the United States. He said he plans to install a second camera in Massachusetts.","Jonathon Keats plans to capture the world’s slowest photograph, a 1,000-year-long exposure of the city of Tempe, Arizona .

Grandmother-of-six Dot Taylor, 48, who has given up trying to find a job after 20 years out of work, has hired the same agent used by the original Benefits Street star used in the hope of finding fame. Barry Tomes who takes care of Dee (real name Deirdre Kelly) told the Mirror that he believes that Dorothy, from Stockton-on-Tees, has a lucrative career ahead of her. Scroll down for video . Dorothy Taylor  has taken on the same agent that helped White Dee rise to fame months before the second series is due to start . He said: 'I'm advising Dot and I'm advising her that there is money to be made for her. 'She is going to be one of the stars of the show. She's a big personality and can make some cash.' Tomes added that there were several characters worth looking out for in the new series who he believes could be equally successful. 'There are a few others who will be the main focus of the show too and I advise them to get some representation. 'It doesn't have to be but if they get looked after in the right way then they will be able to make some money. They only have to look at what I have done with Dee.' Barry Tomes made White Dee famous after helping her on to Celebrity Big Brother where she reportedly accepted a £100,000 fee. Dot says that she has a softer side to her than the outspoken White Dee (real name Deirdre Kelly: right) which she believes will be the secret to fame . At just 4ft 11 Dot says she should be called 'little Dee' Now Dot - who is a diminutive 4ft 11in - wants to be the new matriarch of the TV series and hopes it could bring her fame and fortune. The mother-of-five said: 'I would be 'Little Dee' - I'm fun, me - because of my size. I'm only little, I'm only 4ft 11. 'I don't  took my age, people think I'm younger, I act like a kid. It doesn't bother me.' Dot says that she has a softer side than her Birmingham counterpart and believes this could be the secret to her success. 'I wouldn't mind being the next White Dee. I'm not horrible, I'm nice to people. I could become famous.' TV crews started filming in Kingston Road, Stockton, in August last year and images released from filming revealed a broad set of characters. One resident was even seen leading a horse into the garden of one of the terraced houses in the road. Homes in the street - which stand in the shadow of Holme House Prison - cost an average £50,000 and one in five residents is on benefits. Dot and her husband have lived in a council house on adjacent Cowper Road for more than 20 years. Barry Tomes who represents both White Dee and Dorothy Taylor says that several other characters from the second series should seek representation as he believes they could make a lot of money . Although Dot refused to reveal how much they get in benefits, she admitted neither had worked for more than 20 years. She and her husband have four sons - aged 30, 28, 27 and 22 - and one daughter, 17, as well as six grandchildren all under the age of seven. There's also another one  on the way. Dot said she had 'all sorts of jobs' in the past, including stints in a crisp factory and a nursing home, but had now 'given up' looking for a job. The grandmother puts her lack of job interest down to her devotion to her children. She said: 'I stopped working for the kids really.' 'Most of them [jobs adverts] they say you have to have loads of qualifications, but most people who even have the qualifications can't get a job anyway. Filming for the second series of Benefits Street began last August which saw one resident leading a horse into the garden of his inner-city terraced home . 'They just end up giving up. What's the point in having all these GCSEs and A-levels when you still can't get a job. 'There's no jobs but I think that's all over, not just the area.' Asked if she was worried the area would be portrayed in a bad light, she said: 'No I'm not worried. It shouldn't happen. What you get from this area is the truth. There is nowt bad. 'You know when people condemn the area and say ""I wouldn't live there""? You get that anywhere but this is where I have been brought up. 'There are lots of characters on my street.

The confederation had been expected to give Blatter a unanimous vote of support. But the motion was never put to the 10 delegates, in the knowledge that it would not be fully backed. The South American Football Confederation (CONMEBOL) Congress was held in Paraguay this week . There were signs that Sepp Blatter may not have the unanimous support of South America . CONMEBOL has long been a Blatter stronghold, but a number of the old guard have been replaced by football federation leaders, including President Juan Angel Napout, who won’t necessarily back Blatter at all costs. The significance of the CONMEBOL snub to Blatter is that it was the first confederation gathering since three genuine challengers —Prince Ali of Jordan, Belgium’s Michael van Praag and Portugal’s former world footballer of the year Luis Figo — declared their candidacy for the FIFA presidency. Blatter’s overwhelming shows of support in Asia and Africa occurred when the FIFA president wasn’t expected to face any realistic opposition.

Natural broadcaster Francome  has done no media work since leaving Channel 4 — where he has been hugely missed — after they changed their racing production company from Highflyer to IMG. BBC’s caution at promoting Francome’s exciting return is understood to be because 5 Live do not yet know how much time he will be available to work.

The FA’s £1.5m-a-year official beer brand deal with Budweiser for the FA Cup until 2018 at least gives them small respite from the scrutiny around their year-long failure to land a lead sponsor — ironically to replace Budweiser — for the most famous club knockout competition in football. The Budweiser contract will also give them exposure on the interview backboards for the quarter-finals at the weekend which were giving the impression that William Hill, the betting partner, were the main sponsor.

Missed opportunities against Sunderland and Leicester have left the Tigers hovering three points above the drop zone while their hopes have also been hit by the news that striker Nikica Jelavic faces six weeks on the sidelines after knee surgery. On the face of it a clash with Jose Mourinho's champions elect is the last thing the struggling hosts might wish for but former Tottenham star Dawson is adamant his team can once again rise to the occasion this weekend. Michael Dawson (centre) says his side are not low in confidence and have a great fighting spirit . Dawson said: 'We have got a spirit and a fight about us and we have certainly shown that in recent weeks. It's all about fine margins and at the end of the day we picked up points that might be valuable at the end of the season. 'It is a massive challenge playing against all the top teams but we have been away to Anfield and Manchester City and Arsenal and picked points up and we could quite easily have picked up all three against City.' The Tigers' survival hopes took another hit last week when fellow strugglers Burnley upset Manuel Pellegrini's men at Turf Moor but Dawson says that upset can provide inspiration for his own side on Sunday. The Hull captain remonstrates with referee Jonathan Moss following Tom Huddlestone's sending off . 'You do look at other results, there's no hiding that, and seeing that kind of result definitely gives us that belief,' added Dawson. 'On paper it wasn't one you would look at but credit to Burnley who showed what the Premier League is about.' Jelavic's untimely absence will mean another chance for either record signing Abel Hernandez or Sone Aluko in attack, but the game is likely to come too early for long-term injured trio Mohamed Diame, Robbie Brady and Liam Rosenior. However despite Jelavic's grim immediate prognosis, boss Steve Bruce is determined not to completely write the Croatian striker off and believes he could yet return to play a part in the potentially crucial end-of-season run-in. Bruce said: 'Being realistic we think it's going to be at least six weeks. It could force him out for the rest of the season, but knowing Jela the way I do I am sure he is going to give it a good shot.'

32268c6994c6dfe983d43b52cf0ba42a30040ef6,"Tony Blair has given the Labour Party more than £100,000, in an apparent bid to ingratiate himself with Ed Miliband. The former prime minister, who has a strained relationship with the Labour leader, announced last night that he had given £1,000 to each of the 106 candidates fighting target seats for the party in May. In a letter to candidates, Mr Blair said: ‘I know how hard it can be to raise money to fund a local campaign, but for you, in one of our 106 battleground seats, it is even more vital. This is where the election will be won for Labour and that is why I am making a donation to all 106 campaigns. Former Prime Minister Tony Blair, right, has given the Labour Party more than £100,000 in an apparent bid to ingratiate himself with Ed Miliband, left . ‘As one of our key seat candidates, you know better than most the scale of the challenge we face, but I have every confidence that with your drive, determination and organisational skills, you will deliver a successful local campaign that will also see our party returned to government.’ Labour indicated that Mr Blair will also play a role in the election campaign, despite having made clear that he disapproves of Mr Miliband’s Left-wing stance. The donation represents a relatively modest gesture from Mr Blair, whose personal fortune is estimated at anything up to £100million following years of lucrative consultancies with big corporations and foreign regimes and a string of high-profile property deals. The source of the cash is likely to provoke unease among some Labour MPs, given controversy over Mr Blair’s dealings with dictatorships such as Kazakhstan, and the fact that he remains under the shadow of the Chilcot inquiry into the Iraq war, which is due to be published after the election. His intervention will be seen as a sign that the former prime minister is keen to mend fences with a party leadership that has publicly distanced itself from his creation, New Labour. The donation is a relatively modest gesture given controversy over Mr Blair's dealings with Kazakhstan president Nursultan Nazarbayev, pictured . Although Mr Blair has said he has no desire to return to front-line politics in the UK, friends say he is distressed by the way the party he led to three election victories has turned its back on him. Mr Blair is known to have backed Mr Miliband’s elder brother David for the Labour leadership in 2010. And he has made little secret of his dismay at the way Ed Miliband has dragged Labour to the Left and alienated business. In December, Mr Blair warned that the tactics were likely to lose Labour the election, telling the Economist magazine that the election was shaping up to be one ‘in which a traditional Left-wing party competes with a traditional Right-wing party, with the traditional result’.

Following a drab goalless draw in the initial tie, Reading welcomed Bradford to the Madejski Stadium on Monday night and eased to a 3-0 victory against 10 men to reach just a second semi-final in the history of the club. Hal Robson-Kanu headed home in the sixth minute before a deflected Garath McCleary shot doubled their advantage shortly afterwards.

Filipe Morais was sent off for a high kick on Nathaniel Chalobah before Jamie Mackie thrashed home a third to send the Royals to Wembley. And now Clarke wants to replicate the cup giant-killing exploits of Bradford - who knocked out Chelsea and Sunderland on their way to the sixth round. 'You see tonight what it means to us,' he said of Reading's cup run. 'We go to the semi-final, a difficult game against Arsenal, but we go there with hope and belief that maybe we can continue the good work of Bradford. Bradford have been fantastic underdogs in this tournament this year and we look to pick up the baton now and do it in the semi-final.' Clarke made 11 changes to the side which slipped to a 4-1 defeat at Watford in the Championship on Saturday and believes he made the right decision to do so. The Bantams were reduced to 10-men after this high challenge from midfielder Filipe Morais (left) Referee Mike Jones brandishes a straight red card to Morais as Nathaniel Chalobah (right) looks from the turf . 'I am paid to do a job for the club and I have to do what is correct for the football club and I think I did that,' he added. 'I am pleased for the players - it has been a difficult season for them. It was very comfortable because we got off to a great start. From there we controlled the game very, very well and the third goal was the one that killed it. It was a very comfortable night.' Bradford boss Phil Parkinson, who was given a warm reception at the Madejski Stadium having enjoyed a distinguished 11-year playing career with Reading, felt the stuffing had been knocked out of his players following the hosts' lightning start. 'Reading were the better team on the night and we gave ourselves a mountain to climb,' he said. 'They played with a spring in their step after that and we found it difficult to respond. A two-goal lead after 10 minutes lifted the whole crowd and their players but we have got to be immensely proud. Bradford City boss Phil Parkinson felt the stuffing had been knocked out of his side following the hosts'  start . 'This is tough to take, we wanted to progress but we have got to quickly move on and reflect on this year's competition. 'When you have these cup runs as a lower-league side there is always a danger you will have an off-day. The lads were deflated on the pitch and I couldn't wait to get them into the dressing room at half-time to give them a lift.' Parkinson had no complaints about Morais' second-half red card and was quick to wish Clarke and his players good luck for the remainder of the competition. 'We wish them all the best in the semi-final against Arsenal,' he added. 'We have got 11 games to go, no-one else in our division has had the high-profile games we have had to contend with and the lads have kept going really well. Now we can focus on the league, we are going to have a good go.'","Reading beat Bradford 3-0 in their FA Cup quarter-final replay on Monday .

It's just a group of slobs' Former Buckeye Andrew Norwell, who now plays guard for the Carolina Panthers in the NFL, created the name in 2013, according to The Zone. Norwell came up with nickname while he was drawing pictures in the team's meeting room. Right guard Pat Elflein explained: 'He'd just draw a bunch of goofy pictures and just mash a bunch of animals together. 'He'd just make them look real funny together, and one of them, he made one of them and he called it a slob. 'It was a big, ugly, thing and it just kind of caught on that we're the slobs.' The name caught on and the guys on the team kept using it when Norwell moved on. They will continue to use the affectionate term in the coming season as four out of five of the team's starting offensive lineman will be returning, the Columbus Dispatch reported. Junior linemen Chase Farris said: 'A slob isn't what you look like, a slob is how you act, it's what you are, it's what you do.' 'We go eat, we slob. When we're together in the meeting room, we slob.

0564ad50ac69f95f0629f1e97b7b578d276a3036,"It's thousands of years since mankind won dominance over nature, and we're still pretty proud. But  a top researcher says we've been giving ourselves too much credit - because we were helped by our oldest friends. Humans paired up with dogs as early as 40,000 BC, it is claimed, giving us such an advantage in hunting that it prompted the wipeout of our Neanderthal rivals. Man's best friend: An early cave painting in Libya of dogs chasing a deer in the Akakus Mountains. A new theory claims humans teamed up with the ancestors of domestic dogs far earlier than was first thought . Left behind: While early humans hunted with wolves, their Neanderthal rivals in Europe continued using primitive tools without any help, according to anthropologist Dr Pat Shipman (artist's impression) The controversial theory has been put forward in a new book by leading anthropologist Pat Shipman of Pennsylvania State University. She has challenged the common scientific view that wolves were only domesticated just over 10,000 years ago, after early humans had already asserted a strong foothold in Europe. No match: The theory claims Neanderthals (model pictured) were no match for the hunting technique . Instead, she said, humans began taming and breeding wolves - leading to the pets we know today - soon after they arrived on the continent from Africa up to 70,000 years ago. At the time, our close genetic relatives the Neanderthals were dominant in Europe, fighting for survival as they hunted creatures such as woolly mammoths with primitive tools. But soon afterwards the rival species died out, leaving a clear path for the homo sapiens that make up today's humans. Strong rival theories of their demise include that Neanderthals, just like woolly mammoths, were unable to cope with the changing climate of the last ice age or that humans were better hunters. Dr Shipman, however, told The Observer: 'We formed an alliance with the wolf and that would have been the end for the Neanderthal. 'Early wolf-dogs would have tracked and harassed animals like elk and bison and would have hounded them until they tired. Then humans would have killed them with spears or bows and arrows. 'This meant the dogs did not need to approach these large cornered animals to finish them off – often the most dangerous part of a hunt – while humans didn’t have to expend energy in tracking and wearing down prey. Dogs would have done that. 'Then we shared the meat. It was a win-win situation.' Dr Shipman's theory, shared in her book The Invaders: How Humans and Their Dogs Drove Neanderthals to Extinction, was partly inspired by early dog remains. Crossing paths: Wolves and woolly mammoths co-existed for millennia, but only wolves survived in the end . Close relation: A Natural History museum employee examines a model of a Neanderthal during an exhibition last year. Neanderthals look similar to modern humans but were a distinct species with genetic differences . She examined 33,000-year-old fossils of dogs found in Siberia and Belgium, and looked at how the shapes of their jaws and skulls were different from wild wolves. Although they were far more similar to wolves than the pets of today, there were clear signs of domestication, she said - including shorter snouts, densely-packed teeth and wider jaws. The theory is the latest in a long line about our prehistoric ancestors, many of which contradict each other. Last year a study at the University of Tübingen in Germany claimed early humans emigrated from Africa far earlier than we first thought - and as many as 130,000 years ago. Another study at the University of Chicago said wolves began evolving into domestic dogs between 9,000 and 34,000 years ago, while a third study said dogs may not have evolved from wolves as we know them today at all.","Neanderthals were wiped out after ancient humans arrived from Africa .
Scientists  disagree on why - but top anthropologist may have the answer .

The OAP treasure hunters are digging beneath the streets of the old industrial city of Wuppertal. The Amber Room - valued at around £250million in today's money - was looted from the palace of Peter the Great in Soviet Russia by invading Nazi troops in 1941. It is without doubt the single greatest piece of missing stolen art from World War Two never to be found and has captivated treasure hunters ever since it was first plundered. Some say the panels were destroyed by Soviet artillery fire on the Prussian city of Koenigsberg, others that they were dumped in an Alpine lake by the SS in the closing days of the war. But Karl-Heinz Kleine, 68, and his bowling club pals, say they have proof it was entombed by the Nazis beneath the streets of Wuppertal. Scroll down for video . Digging for treasure: A team of Indiana Jones pensioners being drilling under the German city of Wuppertal, where they are convinced the Amber Room is hidden after it was looted by the Nazis from Russia in 1941 . Lost art: The Amber Room seen in all its glory in 1930 before it was stolen from the Catherine Palace . The city is riddled with subterranean bunkers and tunnels dug by the Nazis. It is here, said Kleine, that he has received information that the crates arrived from Koenigsberg early in 1945 to be hidden. He said: 'Erich Koch, the Nazi gauleiter of East Prussia who died in a Polish prison in 1986, came from Wuppertal. 'As the Red Army closed in on Koenigsberg, he ordered the treasure to be packed up and brought back to his hometown. We have studied records and spoken to people from the time. 'He did not want to leave the world's greatest treasure in a region with an unknown political future; rather he brought it to a place he knew where he had a good chance of accessing it in the future. In his own backyard.' In search of lost treasure: A group of bowling club friends say they have proof the Amber Room was entombed by the Nazis beneath Wuppertal . Following the scent: The group claim to have received information that the crates arrived from Koenigsberg early in 1945 to be hidden in the German city of Wuppertal . Opulent: A complete restoration of the Amber Room in the Catherine Palace of Tsarskoye Selo near Saint Petersburg, the original of which was plundered by the Nazis in World War Two, but has since disappeared . The £250million room, consisting of panels containing six tonnes of amber resin, took ten years to complete. It is without doubt the single greatest piece of missing stolen art from World War Two never to be found . The local authority have given Karl-Heinz and his four friends permission to dig in the Nazi structures and a local building firm has loaned them some heavy drilling equipment. 'I can't reveal who our sources are, but we are not doing this for fun,' he added. 'We will find the Amber Room here.' Others have been just as certain in the past. The Maigret author Georges Simenon founded the Amber Room Club after World War Two to track it down once and for all. Everyone had a different theory of what might have befallen the work. Plundered: The remains of the Amber Room after it was seized by the Nazis, who packed the amber panels in 27 crates and shipped them to Germany, where they vanished never to be seen again . Stripped bare: Some say the panels were destroyed by Soviet artillery fire on the East Prussian city of Koenigsberg, while others claim they were dumped in an Alpine lake by the SS in the closing days of the war . Destroyed: Peter the Great received the room as a gift from the King of Prussia in 1716 and brought it to his new capital, St Petersburg. Here it is seen before restoriation . The Amber Room consists of panels containing six tonnes of amber resin, took ten years to complete and is valued at some £250million in today's money. Peter the Great received the room as a gift from the King of Prussia in 1716 and brought it to his new capital, St Petersburg. The 16-feet of jigsaw-puzzle style panels were constructed of more than 100,000 perfectly fitted pieces of amber. In 1755, it was moved to the Catherine Palace at Tsarkoe Selo, 17 miles south of the Imperial Russian capital. In 1941, the approaching Nazi army surrounded the city, then known by its Soviet name of Leningrad. Tsarkoe Selo was one of the outlying areas occupied by the Germans. They packed the amber panels in 27 crates and shipped them to Germany, where they vanished. Dozens of theories have been put forward for their whereabouts and in some cases, millions spent trying to unearth the treasure, but as yet nothing has been found. In 2006 an American team spent £7million diving into the glacial waters of Lake Toplitz in Austria. Norman Scott, the founder of Global Explorations, said he had a witness who he says specifically counted 27 crates going to the waters of the lake in April 1945, one month before the capitulation of Nazi Germany. Paperwork from the RHSA - the Reich Main Security Office of the SS in wartime - shows the Amber Room was packed into precisely 27 crates before it was taken away by the Germans from Russia. The team also say the Cyrillic lettering on the remains of a wooden crate they found, bearing the words 'fragile' and numbered could mean it once contained a piece of the Amber Room jigsaw. Lake Toplitz was used by Hitler's forces in the last two years of the war for secret underwater experiments using dynamite and rockets. It later turned it into a dumping ground for anything the Nazis wanted to hide from the advancing Allies. But the lake has yielded little since WW2, except for forged £5 notes which were printed by the Nazis and intended to cause chaos for the British economy. In 2011, a book published in Germany claimed the room lies hidden in old mine workings in a forest in east Germany. 'The Puzzle of Poppen Wood' by Mario Ulbrich unleashed a fresh wave of treasure hunters who arrived at weekends with shovels, metals detectors and vast reserves of optimism to scour for the artwork. Casualties of war: Inhabitants of Leningrad (now St Petersburg) flee after a German bomb attack in the winter of 1941 when the Nazis seized the Amber Room during their assault on the city . The Catherine Palace in St Petersburg (as seen in 2010) where the Amber Room is housed . Ulbrich interviewed foresters, policemen, miners and old Nazis for his work which chronicles two decades of largely unreported quarrying in the wood near Zwickau. Matthias Gluba, a civil engineer and hobby historian on WW2, has triggered another Amber Room frenzy after researching wartime records of the town of Auerswalde near Chemnitz. Auerswalde was the place where Hitler built the two biggest guns in history - Dora and Gustav - both mighty railway mounted monsters capable of hurling shells weighing tons. As he probed into the history of the cannons he discovered plans for secret underground workings. Then he found details of a clandestine shipment from the city of Koenigsberg - now Kaliningrad and part of Russia but in 1945 the main city of Germany's province of East Prussia - which was the last known storage place of the Amber Room before it fell to the Red Army. Art haul: The room was plundered by Adolf Hitler's Nazis during the Second World War . Prussian count Sommes Laubach, the Germans' 'art protection officer' and holder of a degree in art history, supervised the room's transport to Koenigsberg Castle from the Soviet Union. In January 1945, after air raids and a savage ground assault on the city, the room was lost. Gluba found documents about an air raid on the marshalling yards of Breslau - then German, now the Polish city of Wroclaw - on 4 February 1945. The army report stated that 40 wagons from Koneigsberg, which had fallen days earlier to the Red Army, were undamaged in the attack and were moving down to Auerswalde 'under conditions of the greatest secrecy.' Gunter Richter, now 80, is an Auerswalde resident who told Glube that, as a child, he remembered in the Muna Forest outside the town a massive shelter built for munitions works employees that he went into as a boy. It vanished off of maps after the war but in March 2011 he and Gluba managed to find a ventilation shaft that leads down into a subterranean structure they believe is the old shelter. They, and others, have still not managed to access it. Many Amber Room purists believe the treasure lies in the Jonas Valley in what was the former German Democrat Republic. It is the most dangerous of the hunting grounds and draws scores of illegal searchers every weekend. The centre of the Jonas Valley is at Ohrdruf and was the site of the S-IIIFuhrer headquarters. It is a tunnel system many miles in length with thousands of caves, bunkers and storerooms. It was intended to be the Alamo of the Third Reich leadership. Americans liberated it and US authorities have since classified all 1945 documents relating to Ohrdruf for a minimum of 100 years. 'Like no other place in Germany this wild canyon has ignited the fantasies of an international league of conspiracy theorists and treasure hunters, 'wrote Der Spiegel, Germany's top news magazine. Both above and below ground, the area is littered with shells and bombs big enough to destroy a city block. At weekends authorities play cat-and-mouse with the treasure hunters who enter the sealed-off area illegally in ones and twos - and sometimes in mini-bus groups - armed with metal detectors and a belief in the stories. Fortune hunter Martin Stade, author of 'Amber Rooms In Thuringia And Other Hollow Spaces,' likes to guide treasure seekers through the Jonas Valley. Stade believes that Hitler had UFO-like flying saucers developed in bunkers at the site - as well as using one of the chambers as a repository for the Amber Room.","£250m room was looted from palace of Peter the Great by the Nazis in 1941 .

98f9df3c7c35c9dd129fc5a9f0cfd00eb566d9cc,"Michael Carrick has credited the return to form which has seen him recalled to the England squad down to the influence of Manchester United manager Louis Van Gaal. The midfielder, hailed by Sir Alex Ferguson last year as the best English player in the game, has won countless club trophies but struggled for consistency at international level throughout his career. Now 33 years old, he is one of the oldest heads in Roy Hodgson’s squad and is a strong contender for a place at the bottom of the midfield diamond the England manager so often prefers to deploy. Michael Carrick is happy to be back in the England squad and has credited his return to Louis van Gaal . Carrick had particular praise for the Manchester United manager's aura and straightforward nature . ‘Van Gaal has improved me,’ Carrick said. ‘Certain situations in games, he's helped, not just individually but as a unit, as a defensive unit, as a group of players. I've definitely learnt from him. ‘He's been great from the start for me. I couldn't ask for any more from him in terms of what he's given me, and the support and confidence to be a big part of the team. ‘A lot of people at the top of their field, whether it's business or sport, tend to have that aura, and he's certainly got that belief and clarity in what he wants and what he expects from players. 'He's really straightforward and honest. ‘What you guys see when he speaks publicly, he's exactly the same with us. He's straight down the line and honest and says it exactly as it is.’ Van Gaal puts an arm around Carrick after they helped United to victory against Liverpool at Anfield . Carrick says he couldn't ask for any more from Van Gaal in terms of support and confidence he has given . Carrick is still yearning to improve his game further, despite moving into the twilight of his career, and tries to learn from the very best in his role. ‘You can look at a few – Andrea Pirlo, Xabi Alonso, Sergio Busquets,’ he said. ‘Busquets probably doesn’t get enough credit for what he brings to Barcelona. There’re a few out there. ‘I thought Marco Verratti and Thiago Motta for Paris Saint-Germain against Chelsea were terrific, especially when they went down to 10 men. I like watching and still trying to learn from others.’ Carrick has also gained his footballing education alongside one of the midfield masters in Paul Scholes, and their former United team-mate and England coach Gary Neville compared the pair to ‘going into a bar and hearing a piano playing’ due to the calm they brought to the midfield together. Andrea Pirlo was the first name mentioned by Carrick in terms of midfielders around Europe he looks up to . Xabi Alonso (right) was also mentioned, as well as Sergio Busquets in midfielder for Barcelona . Carrick felt Marco Verratti (bottom) did a brilliant job for Paris Saint-Germain against Chelsea in Europe . ‘It made me laugh,’ Carrick said. ‘I can see Nev saying that, but it was quite nice in a way. Playing alongside Scholesy I learned so much. He’d take the ball anywhere, he’d put his foot on the ball and try to have influence on the game. ‘It is a lot about your personality, as a person, as a player, that is how I am really, quite quiet and understated, it suits me.’ Gary Neville (centre) compared Carrick's calmness to ‘going into a bar and hearing a piano playing’ Carrick has become a key part of United's side as they look to secure a place in the Premier League top four . In the absence of Steven Gerrard and Frank Lampard, England’s midfield is crying out for an experienced head in the middle and Carrick, if he can stay injury free, is eyeing Euro 2016 as his tournament. ’That’s definitely what I’m striving towards,’ he added. ‘I’ d love to have another real crack at it. Trying to have a bigger influence in the team is the target.’","Michael Carrick has been recalled to the England squad by Roy Hodgson .

Mother's grief: Raphael Hearn, seated, listens as Erica Gross gives a victim's statement to the court during Hearn's sentencing in the courtroom of Judge Ulysses Boykin at the Frank Murphy Hall Of Justice . Kamiya Gross was shot in the head on July 1, 2014, outside a house in Inkster, southwest of Detroit. French and a 13-year-old girl, Chelsea Lancaster, were wounded in the attack. Kamiya was the intended target, police initially said, in retaliation for an earlier shooting in which Jackson held the girl's father responsible. Jackson also was sentenced to up to 45 years in prison for torture and assault with intent to murder. A jury convicted him earlier this month. Raphael Hearn also was sentenced Tuesday to life in prison for first-degree murder. Prosecutors say Hearn helped Jackson plan and carry out the attack. His attorney that the defendant played no part in the killing. Kenneth French had a harsh message for Jackson's co-defendant: 'Do yourself a favor and kill yourself because the world is not going to miss you.' Boykin called the girl's slaying 'one of the most heinous crimes' he's ever seen. River of tears: Following the sentencing of Raymone Jackson and Raphael Hearn, Wendy French, left, hugs Erica Gross outside the courtroom . Survivors: Kenneth French, Kamiya's dad (left), and family friend Chelsea Lancaster (right), 13, were wounded in the attack but survived . Erica Gross, Kamiya's mother, sneered at Jackson. 'Whatever happens to you, you will never know how I feel,' she said. 'Have a great life.' When given an opportunity to speak before being sentenced, Jackson apologized to the girl's families. 'I'd like to say that none of this was supposed to happen,' he said. Erica Gross brought Kamiya to her father's home at around 3.30pm July 1, 2014, before heading to work. About five hours later, Inkster police received a 911 call about shots fired outside a home in the 30000 block of Carlyle Street. Kamiya Gross was shot at a point blank range and was pronounced dead at the scene. She was just 10 days shy of her third birthday, which she had been hoping to celebrate with her many cousins at a Chuck E. Cheese restaurant. The toddler was shot in the head and killed while playing on the porch of her father's Inkster, Michigan . All that's left: A pair of pink and black sandals sit on a blood-spattered porch where a toddler was shot dead and two others were wounded . Payback: Police said the fatal attack may have been in retaliation for a shooting at a nightclub in April that left the suspect wounded . Her father, Kenneth French, was taken to a hospital in stable condition, and family friend Chelsea Lancaster, then age 12, was hospitalized in critical condition. The victims were sitting on Kenneth French's porch when a man, later identified as Raymone Jackson, marched up to them and opened fire. Jackson was sentenced to 11 months in the Wayne County Jail in September 2013 in a drug case while on parole for a 2010 drug conviction. He was released in March 2014 for good behavior, about three months before Kamiya was slain. Before he left jail, the Michigan Department of Corrections had the option to pick Jackson up and return him to prison as a violation of parole in the 2010 conviction, but the state declined to do so, a jail spokeswoman said last year.","Kamiya Gross was shot in the head at point blank range in Inkster, Michigan, in July 2014 .

Last season Hull City striker George Boyd was banned for three matches after being found guilty of spitting at Manchester City goalkeeper Joe Hart. However, the FA upped the punishment for spitting to six games to come in line with new FIFA guidelines, which state that any player 'dismissed from the Field of Play for spitting at an opponent or any other person' will be suspended 'following the match in which he was sent off until such time as his Club has completed its next six matches in approved Competitions.' If found guilty, Cisse will be banned for an extra game because of a previous violent conduct ban for elbowing Everton’s Seamus Coleman. Afterwards, Van Gaal defended Evans. ‘I did not see that (incident) from the bench, but I cannot imagine he would do that,’ said the Dutchman. Newcastle head coach John Carver said: ‘You can't do it can you? It's one of the worst things in football. But I can't comment on it, I just know there was a fracas on the halfway line and I need to have a look at it.’ Neither player was booked at the time by referee Anthony Taylor, who awarded a free-kick to Newcastle for the original tangle, but if the official missed the spitting incident the pair could face retrospective action from the FA. The Senegalese striker points the finger at Manchester United's defender after the incident . Tempers threaten to boil over as team-mates from Newcastle and United gather on the pitch . Former Manchester United midfielder Paul Scholes, covering the match as a pundit for BT Sport, slammed Cisse while suggesting Evans wasn’t a guilty party. ‘I think Jonny is spitting on the floor. I know Jonny, he’s not that type of person,’ he said. ‘If he wants to do that then it’s not hard to miss, is it? He’s only stood a yard away from him. What Cisse does afterwards is unforgivable.’ Scholes’ colleague, ex-Liverpool and Real Madrid star Steve McManaman, said: ‘I’d like to think he (Evans) is spitting at the floor and not at Cisse. But then Papiss Cisse stands up and spits right at Jonny Evans’ neck from about six inches. It’s absolutely disgusting.’ Van Gaal, meanwhile, was relieved to see Young steal three points on a night when all of the top four won. ‘I was very pleased with the win, especially here,’ he said. ‘I lost here as a coach of Barcelona and AZ Alkmaar. I knew it was difficult and Ryan Giggs said there is a lot of pressure from the crowd. But we made the crowd quiet. The players share heated moments at St James' Park as they exchange points of view . ‘But we don’t reward ourselves (with goals). If you don’t reward yourselves you can get negative results and David de Gea had to make two fantastic saves. ‘It was important to win after you see all of the results of our competitors in our rat race. ‘Everyone is now full of confidence going into the FA Cup game with Arsenal.’ As for Carver, he was furious that Newcastle were denied an early penalty when Chris Smalling fouled Emmanuel Riviere. ‘It’s frustrating and I’m so disappointed for the guys,’ he said. ‘For 89 minutes we were outstanding but we don’t have world-class players like they do. ‘To concede like we did is disappointing but what is more disappointing is the blatant penalty in the first half which was not given. Anthony Taylor is a human-being and he’s missed it. That would have set us up nicely.’","The pair collided near half-way line and Evans appeared to spit at Cisse .

Nik Simon talks to Warburton and Wales wing legend Shane Williams about the game which could decide the Six Nations Championship. Nik Simon: You'll become Wales's most-capped captain on Saturday. What's the secret? Sam Warburton: I take it with a pinch of salt because there are more games now than 30 years ago. Warren Gatland put his faith in me when I was quite young and he's stuck with me. Before I took up the role, some people said 'If someone's out of line, then you have to give it to them'. Rather than the Roy Keane approach, and as a Spurs fan, I like to compare myself to Ledley King. Sportsmail's Nik Simon speaks to Wales captain Sam Warburton and former Test winger Shane Williams . Warburton (left) is set to captain Wales for a record 34th time against Ireland in Cardiff on Saturday . Former Wales and Lions winger Williams believes his Warburton's side are still in the running for the title . Simon: Ryan Jones previously held the record, how do the two compare? Shane Williams: To be captain, you have to be well liked by the players. Warburton came in at the latter stage of my career and was much younger than me, so it was a little strange to have him as captain. But he impressed me straight away and, like Ryan, he trained hard and played hard. Simon: Wales are still in the running for the championship despite losing to England in round one. Are there shades of 2013? Warburton: It's going that way. Our experience in 2013 has given us the belief that we can do it. It was tough then because all the Wales teams previously had won a Grand Slam. Ryan sat us down and gave us the belief that we needed. We've had our one lifeline but we've got the motivation that it's still possible. Williams: Fate is always in your hands with the Six Nations, that's what makes it special. It's an open championship. Ireland are favourites to win in Cardiff but you can't write anyone off — one result can change everything. Simon: Jonathan Sexton ran the show against England. How much of a threat is he? Warburton: If I'm being honest, I didn't see the game live because I was watching Tottenham v Chelsea in the Capital One Cup final. I flicked back and forth to see the rugby score. But Johnny is a massive part of the Irish team. His attention to detail impressed me on the Lions tour and he knew every move so intricately. He deserves to be known as one of the best players in the world. Ryan Jones (centre) previously held the record for Wales's most-capped captain . Simon: How do you defend against Sexton and Conor Murray's kicking game? Williams: The game is changing and there's a massive focus on rugby league style kicks. When I saw the state of Tommy Bowe at the end last week, he had chased a lot of kicks and was very tired. It helps being six-foot plus when you're taking high balls. Dan Biggar is one of the best in the world at kicking the ball in the air, running 40 yards, and catching it. It sounds easy but it's such a big part of the game now. Simon: Who would you select in the Welsh back-three? Williams: Defensively, Leigh Halfpenny is the best full back in the world. George North is my first-choice winger because he's such a talented footballer. On the other wing I would keep Liam Williams, who's the form player in Wales. Scott Baldwin and Luke Charteris were both very good in the pack against France — especially with the 100 per cent lineout — and I wouldn't make any changes for the weekend… if it isn't broken don't fix it! Fly half Jonathan Sexton (right) has been superb for Ireland during this years's tournament . Simon: Can the Welsh half-backs match the Irish? Williams: I've been very impressed with Biggar and Rhys Webb. They've made those positions theirs at the moment and they are able to take pressure off each other through their time management and kicking games. It helps that they've been together at Ospreys and they will have to be on top of their game against Murray and Sexton, because they're the world's in-form combination. Simon: England were blitzed at the breakdown in Dublin, are you putting extra focus on that area? Warburton: Out of all the Six Nations teams I've played against, Ireland have been the most effective at the breakdown. I've not been rewarded as much at the breakdown as I was last year. I haven't made as many turnovers as I would have liked. The post-tackle stuff is always an add-on after training and Shaun Edwards always barks at us when we're doing it. It's key to our game plan. Simon: Ireland have lost just twice in Cardiff in 32 years, why are they so successful? Williams: In the nicest possible way, they take an arrogant approach and expect to win every game. They've had players like Paul O'Connell, Brian O'Driscoll and Ronan O'Gara, who have been able to win these kind of games. They have belief and mental toughness. When they're playing well, they build up confidence and are a very tough team to stop. Wales head coach Warren Gatland (centre) will be pitting his wits against fellow Kiwi Joe Schmidt this week . Simon: What's the key to countering that record? Warburton: Like every international match, there are three areas: set piece, breakdown, kicking game. If you can come out on top in two of those three then that's probably going to be the key. I think the breakdown and the kicking game will be the two key areas against Ireland. We're back at our own little nest in the Vale and we're back at home. After two wins, confidence is high. Simon: Warren Gatland vs Joe Schmidt will be an interesting coaching battle — how do the two Kiwis compare? Williams: They both stick to the game plan they want to play. Schmidt uses the players as a tool to work out how Ireland are going to play, rather than trying to fit them into a certain game-plan. Warren Gatland is very similar. Warren's got a great way with people. He gets the best out of his players by taking the mick out of them. I used to come off the field and, with a glint in his eye, he would say 'oh you were rubbish today!'. He loves the wind-up and he loves getting his players going. Schmidt is very straight down the line. He says it as it is and gets the best out of his players by being honest. They're different personalities but they're both hugely successful. Wales winger George North makes a strong carry during his side's victory against France in Paris . Simon: Wales are still in the running… How much of a World Cup confidence boost would it be to win the Six Nations? Warburton: I don't think the Six Nations will have much bearing on the World Cup. In 2011 that wasn't the case. The Six Nations didn't reflect our World Cup campaign. Last year's autumn campaign finished well for us but that didn't transfer into the first game against England. I don't think there's much of a trend with Wales. The most important period will be the three months we're together in the summer. We'll treat that like a pre-season.

Investigators found no trauma or injuries to the baby girl, whose mother was seven months pregnant, according to Boulder County Coroner Emma Hall. Dynel Catrece Lane, 34, was charged with attempted murder and unlawful termination of a pregnancy on Friday. Hall said there was no evidence the unborn child survived outside of victim Michelle Wilkins' womb. Boulder County District Attorney Stan Garnett said his office would not seek a murder charge against Lane, according to KTLA. Scroll down for video . Dynel Catrece Lane (above), 34, was charged with attempted murder and unlawful termination of a pregnancy on Friday . Victim Michelle Wilkins, 26, was released from hospital on Wednesday and her family said she is taking the first tentative steps in a long journey towards recovery and spiritual reconciliation . Under Colorado law, a person can be charged with murdering a baby only if there is evidence the baby was alive outside of the mother's body. 'At this time neither the autopsy or the investigation have provided any evidence that the baby exhibited any signs of life outside of the womb,' said Hall. 'Therefore the circumstance is not being considered a live birth. 'No evidence of trauma or injuries were found on the body. Final autopsy results will be released once all testing and further studies are complete.' Garnett said final results on the cause of death will take six to eight weeks, and he said the coroner's conclusion that it was not a live birth precluded the filing of murder charges. Lane was also charged with two counts each of first and second-degree assault. She faces eight criminal counts and up to 48 years in prison if convicted of first-degree attempted murder, and up to 32 years on each of the other charges of assault and unlawful termination of pregnancy. Lane (above) faces more than 100 years  in prison and is currently being held in jail on a $2million bond . Wilkins, 26, was released from hospital on Wednesday, according to Times-Call. Her family said they are aware of the charges that were announced by the district attorney's office in a statement on Friday. Following her release from the hospital, they said she is taking the first tentative steps in a long journey towards recovery and spiritual reconciliation. They also said Michelle believes her recovery is directly aided by the prayers and positive energy she is receiving. Wilkins had moved to Colorado and just started a job teaching pottery classes. On March 18, she answered a Craigslist ad for baby clothes in a suburban neighborhood of Longmont, about 30 miles from Denver. She was glassed in the neck and then attacked with a small knife in the basement, allegedly by Dynel Lane. The suspect then fled with the baby, who was found by Lane's husband, taking her last breath's in the bathtub. Lane reportedly told her husband that she had suffered a miscarriage and he took her to hospital with the baby. The accused attacker told hospital staff she had suffered a miscarriage but later admitted her atrocious deed. On March 18, Wilkins (above) answered a Craigslist ad for baby clothes when she went to Lane's home and was glassed in the neck and was attacked with a small knife . Family Statement . March 25, 2015 . Today marks a week since the brutal attack that nearly cost Michelle her life and ended that of her soon to be born baby Aurora. She is now out of the hospital in a safe location and accompanied by her partner Dan, is taking the first tentative steps along a long journey towards recovery and spiritual reconciliation. She is surrounded by friends and family and wishes to express her deep gratitude for all the expressions of love, kindness, and spiritual solidarity she has received from both the Longmont community and from around the world. Michelle believes her recovery is directly aided by the prayers and positive energy she is receiving. We cannot predict what lies ahead for Michelle. We have no guidebook on how to navigate this crisis, or a checklist on what to do next. We wish there were. What we can say is that we have all been deeply moved by the many people who have reached out to Michelle and her partner to share their own personal stories of tragedies they’ve endured and how they managed to first just survive and then eventually start to heal. That alone has given us the strength to get up and face each day. You’ve touched our hearts and souls and we thank you so much. For the many members of the media who have reached out to us, we thank you for your continuing interest in Michelle’s well being and the civility that has marked almost all the reporting. We hope you understand our continuing desire for privacy as we try and regroup, pull our lives together, and focus on Michelle’s well-being and recovery. There may be a time in the future where she chooses to share her story, but now is not the moment. Source: GoFundMe . Around 2.30pm, Miss Wilkins managed to make a 911 call as she lay bleeding out on the basement floor. During the desperate six-minute call, she faintly told the dispatcher: 'She cut me in the stomach... I'm pregnant... I'm bleeding out.' The police officers who found her, Billy Sawyer and Phil Piotrowski, described finding Wilkins weak and in a state of shock. 'I started yelling and Michelle yelled back, very faintly, and it was muffled — ""Help me! Help me!""' Sawyer told KTLA this weekend. He described finding her covered from head to toe in blood. 'So I put some gloves on and held her hand and went through where her injuries were … trying to figure out exactly what we had,' he said. Piotrowski believed that Miss Wilkins was the one who 'saved her own life.' 'She is probably one of the strongest people I've ever had the pleasure to meet,' he said. The situation was so bad that he had to leave the room for a moment to compose himself. Lane was arrested at Longmont United Hospital (above) after first telling hospital staff she had suffered a miscarriage but later admitted her atrocious deed . The case has revived the highly charged debate over when a fetus can legally be considered a human being. Even though the baby girl died, legal experts say the situation is complicated by the fact that Colorado is one of 12 states that do not have laws making the violent death of an unborn child a homicide. State legislators in 2013 voted down such a measure over fears it would interfere with abortion rights, and voters overwhelmingly agreed when they rejected a similar ballot measure in 2014. Advocates say the attack shows the need for a fetal homicide law. A preliminary hearing has been scheduled for May 5 and Lane remains held in jail on a $2million bond.","Dynel Lane, 34, was charged with attempted murder and unlawful termination of a pregnancy on Friday among other charges .

52c9a9cdbf4aa742511a2615bd47042f3b707604,"Leicester, England (CNN)Richard III, the King found beneath a car parking lot, has been reburied in a solemn but celebratory service, 530 years after his death in battle. The remains of the medieval monarch were sensationally rediscovered beneath a blanket of tarmac in the center of Leicester in August 2012. They have been pored over by scientists at the city's university ever since, but after more than two years of legal wranglings, the bones were finally laid to rest Thursday in a coffin built by Richard III's distant relative, Michael Ibsen, whose DNA helped prove their identity. It was standing room-only at Leicester Cathedral -- which had been partially rebuilt for the occasion -- as Archbishop of Canterbury Justin Welby led prayers for the long-dead King, swinging incense and sprinkling holy water over the casket, before scattering it with earth from key locations marking his birth, life and death. Oscar-nominated actor Benedict Cumberbatch, a distant cousin of England's last Plantagenet King, read a poem dedicated to Richard III, written by Poet Laureate Carol Ann Duffy. ""My bones, scripted in light, upon cold soil, a human braille. My skull, scarred by a crown, emptied of history. Describe my soul as incense, votive, vanishing; your ownthe same. Grant me the carving of my name."" Queen Elizabeth, represented at the ceremony by the Countess of Wessex, sent a special message to mark the reinterment, which she hailed as ""an event of great  national and international significance."" ""Today we recognize a King who lived through turbulent times and whose Christan faith sustained him in life and death,"" it read. But though it bore many of the hallmarks of grief -- polished coffin, empty tomb, relatives clad in gloomy, pitch-dark suits -- this was not, the organizers insisted, a sad occasion. ""This is not a funeral at which we mourn,"" said Professor Gordon Campbell, of the University of Leicester, welcoming the congregation to the cathedral, just yards from that famous parking lot. Instead, the aim of the service was to offer Richard III a fitting farewell, and a lasting memorial -- neither of which he was granted following his death at Bosworth in 1485. Back then, his body was slung over a horse and carried back to Leicester -- legend has it that his head struck Bow Bridge on the way -- before being put on display for three days, to prove to friends and foes alike that he really was dead, before being slung into a hastily-dug grave at the Church of the Grey Friars. Now Richard's bones, accompanied by a specially-crafted rosary, recognizing his Catholic faith, rest in a lead-lined coffin of English oak, his grave marked by a 2.3 ton block of pale Swaledale fossil limestone resting on a plinth of black Kilkenny marble carved with his name, dates, coat of arms, and his symbol: a white boar. Speaking before the commemorations, Philippa Langley, founder of the ""Looking for Richard"" project, said she did not expect to feel upset at the reinterment: ""Richard died over 500 years ago, so I don't think there will be a sense of sadness there at all. I hope there's perhaps some joy, that something has been done well and right and that we've made peace with the past."" But Ibsen admitted he found Sunday's service at which the remains were carried in to the cathedral surprisingly moving: ""there was a slight dampening of the eyeballs, which caught me completely unawares,"" he said phlegmatically. ""Leicester born and bred"" sisters Susan Foster and Sharon Stirling were among the crowds waiting outside the cathedral to listen in on the service and catch a glimpse of the guests arriving. ""This is history, isn't it, it's never going to happen again,"" said Foster. ""We grew up with all the stories of Richard III. We lived close to Bow Bridge, so we know all the legends about him."" Stirling said she thought the Richard III story would be a big bonus for the city: ""I think it will boost the economy and bring visitors in -- he's got quite a fan club, after all."" Leicester has always been proud of its links to Richard III; the city boasts pubs and schools named in his honor, there's a walking tour and a brand new visitor center built over his original grave. But in recent days, interest has risen to fever pitch: shop windows are full of Richard-themed displays offering everything from wooden toy castles to chain mail jewelery. The florist around the corner from the cathedral is doing a roaring trade in white roses, which people have been leaving at Richard III's statue, and his face is emblazoned on all manner of souvenirs, from paperweights and pens to mugs and bars of chocolate. There's even a ""Return of the King"" beer -- locally brewed and promising ""a distinctive regal flavor."" Some 35,000 people lined the bunting-and-flag-draped streets of Leicester and its surrounding villages on Sunday to watch as the King's coffin was carried in a procession out to the scene of his death and back again. Another 20,000 lined up for hours to file past the casket and pay their respects as it lay ""in repose"" at the cathedral in the days since, watched over by an honor guard of veterans. Among them was Jane Gregory, who traveled two hours by bus from her home in South Derbyshire twice in a week to be there. ""It was just something I had to see and experience -- it's part of history,"" she told CNN outside the reburial service on Thursday. ""I came on Monday too, to view the coffin -- it was a great experience. I queued for two and a half hours and it was worth every minute."" History enthusiast Paul Eames stood in the drizzle and watched the service on his iPad after missing out on a ticket -- to his wife Karen: ""I applied for tickets for both of us; I could have cried when I saw the envelope with her name on it."" ""I didn't originally want to go,"" Karen admitted, smiling. ""But he told me 'you'll be part of history, you don't realize!' The service was amazing, really lovely."" Not everyone was there just to celebrate Richard III, though. Leicester student Sherry Xie said she was ""proud"" of her university's role in the discovery of his bones, but she and her classmate Wendy Jiang admitted they'd come along with an ulterior motive: ""to see Benedict!"" In his sermon, the Bishop of Leicester, Tim Stevens said those who had joined the commemorations ""(came) not to judge, condemn or praise, but to stand in silent, humble and reverent attentiveness at the meeting place of time and eternity."" Stevens said the search for Richard III had ""broken open not just a car park, but a nation's story."" It also provoked bitter quarrels between rival factions over where and how he should be buried, and how much scientific testing he should be subjected to. But Campbell insisted that the service was held in a ""spirit of reconciliation,"" a thought echoed by Stevens: ""Whether we bear a white or a red rose, whether for Richard or Henry ... whether for Leicester or York, we recognize at the graveside that all our journeys lead us to this place, where reputation counts for nothing and all human striving turns to dust."" Langley, the driving force behind the search for the King, said Thursday's service would mark the end of one chapter in the long-running saga; but she said work to re-examine Richard's life and legacy would go on. ""It's the conclusion to his story in that he's been found ... and we're laying his physical remains to rest. But in terms of Richard's story, that is only just beginning.""","Remains of Richard III were sensationally rediscovered 530 years after death .

7d35f9866f9efbdde1e0c6d9bbb94969fdf33f51,"Could you work with your mother every day? One Exeter University student did just that - ditching a degree in German and Philosophy to come and work in his mum's cafe. Rowan Joyce, 52, runs the South Street Coffee and Ice Cream Shop in Isleworth, Middlesex, with her son Tom. Tom, 24, started working at the business while on a summer holiday from Exeter University and enjoyed the role so much that he packed in his course and became joint manager of the store, taking control of the ice cream-making side of the business. Rowan Joyce (left) displays some of her home baked cakes, while Tom shows off his ice cream (right) Rowan tells FEMAIL in her own words why she thinks her son made the right decision and explains how they haven't looked back since... She says: Every middle class Mum wants her child to go to university and when Tom got a place to read German and Philosophy at Exeter I was thrilled. 'I've got two degrees myself and though they haven't done me a bit of good in the workplace I had fun getting them and the one I got from the OU while I was at home bringing up the kids kept me sane and my brain ticking over when I was immersed in child rearing. 'My jobs have always been low pay and hands on practical, mostly retail management and estate agency. Tom and Rowan . 'I figured with Tom if the worst came to the worst the language would always come in useful and he could get a job as an air steward! (Yes, I had a brief spell as an air hostess myself) 'We opened South Street on an absolute shoe string and as Tom was home for Easter from Exeter I employed him to help scrub floors, scrape walls, paint, paper and clean. 'It was hard, boring, work and Tom was not the best employee, he tended to get bored easily or give up if things got difficult. 'I was paying him a wage so technically he should have done as he was told but if it's your kid it's not always as easy as all that: you have to maintain the relationship no matter what and you can't sack them! 'A year on and the business was going well, having worked in retail management I was used to handling staff but I was surprised to find that staffing was turning into my biggest headache. 'Maybe I'm naive and too willing to trust but I found myself being ripped off, cheated and lied to. 'I was paying above minimum wage, providing paid sickness and holidays, treating my staff with consideration and respect. 'But I was discovering that they were opening late and closing early when I wasn't there, claiming for hours they hadn't worked, taking days off sick when they were perfectly well and sitting around on their phones or the work laptop when I was paying them to work. 'By August of that summer it was time to bite the bullet and sack my only full time member of staff. 'He was claiming to be ill, I was paying him sickness benefit and working seven days a week to provide cover and I discovered he wasn't actually ill at all, he just didn't fancy coming into work. 'The afternoon I finally got up the courage to sack him I was upset and worried, another staffing disaster, who could I turn to now? Who could I trust to love and understand my business as I did? Tom is very creative with his ice cream flavours . 'South street demands a very personal touch, it's all about word of mouth, friendships, trust and kindness. 'I always tell my staff the only thing you can do wrong here (apart from stealing of course!) is be rude to a customer. 'There is very little footfall here and we rely on repeat business and word of mouth. 'It's hands-on hard work, you have to be smiley and polite all the time and we provide a lot of bereavement counselling and childcare advice. 'We find people jobs and nannies, locate lost pets and impart cooking tips and marriage guidance. 'Tom and I were doing American night that night: every so often we pick a food theme and sell 20 tickets to an evening meal. This one involved bbq and homemeade baked beans, cornbread and 'slaw. Rowan behind the counter at the shop . 'We were in the backyard lighting the bbq when he told me that I didn't need to worry too much about finding another full timer: he was planning on giving up Uni and working for me full time. 'Actually I was delighted, relieved and delighted, then I felt guilty. Surely I should be putting his education before my business? 'I knew his father (we're divorced) would be furious. 'I knew he wasn't happy at Exeter, the course wasn't really what he'd hoped, he was a bit older than his classmates (he'd done a gap year in Germany) and the next year would bring another year in Germany which he really didn't want to do. 'He was ready to settle down into a proper job in one place and put down some roots. He also wanted to be part of building the business. 'I'm very keen to get my other two children into the business but they are resisting for some reason! 'It's funny to think now but Tom has always been a home bird. Tom selling his ice cream on a summer afternoon . 'He absolutely hated leaving me to go to nursery and although he got on well at school and had a lovely girlfriend for years he was never one for going out and socialising much, he just always liked being at home. 'I guess South Street is an extension of that, it is very cosy and homely! 'Tom took over the ice cream making which was a massive relief for me as it is very sticky, hard work and labour intensive. 'He soon displayed a real genius for it. its quite technical as you have to get the right balance of fat and sugar and its something that demands a lot of expertise and know how. 'If you come up with a flavour he will know how to turn it into ice cream! 'I'm quite good at coming up with flavours, I'm a cook and I know food and what works with what, and I listen to my customers and what they'd like to try. Tom is brilliant at translating those ideas into ice cream. 'I know I can trust him 100 per cent -  he has bought shares in the business and although I am technically the boss (I am his mum!) we have equal shares. South Street Coffee and Ice Cream Shop in Isleworth, Middlesex . 'He is as passionate about making South Street work as I am, he loves our customers and our product as much as I do, we are family! 'I know our customers really identify with us as a family business, they love the way we interact - although I was once accused of having an incestuous relationship with him! 'It does have its down side! If I get angry with him I get FURIOUS, and he is the same, we are both pretty volatile and he always knows how to drive me nuts. 'I have to be really careful about respecting boundaries also, allowing him to have proper time off and not ask him to do more than a regular employee. 'I'm also aware that sometimes I make excuses for him, cut him too much slack and let him get away with things I shouldn't. 'He is always going to be my baby boy: even though he's over six foot with a big beard!' We both like looking after people, I think that's why we work so well together. I still get a rush when I enter the front of house and every seat is taken, each table filled with people happy to be eating delicious, home-made food and fresh gelato. We both take a great joy in providing a service that is becoming rarer to find nowadays: a friendly, independent place to be; not only existing within the local community but comprising a major part of it. The fact that Mum loves to cook makes us a good team. It means that she can stay in the kitchen, cook three cakes and a quiche and knock out lunches at> the same time (seriously, she is that quick and organised,) and I can look after the front of house, making coffee and serving ice cream and cake. We're an efficient machine because we know where each other's strengths lie. Of course, that also means I get tetchy when I see her making coffee: I'm a perfectionist with more experience behind the machine, but you try telling your mum she's not making that latte the correct way. Why would I give up a university degree to work with my mum? Let's be honest, what's the job market like for graduates nowadays? Not great. I was halfway through a four year degree and I knew that the situation wasn't likely to improve. This was a chance to become part of something huge, and the company needed me. I had gradually usurped the role of ice cream maker from mum (to be honest, I think she was secretly glad) and had got to the point where I could tell the temperature of the gelato in the machine by sound alone. I believed in the product 100 per cent and still do: no one else is doing innovative, artisan gelato the way we do it, and our business growth speaks for itself: We now have a dedicated factory, as well as an art gallery/gift shop. I love working with my hands, directly contributing to the success of our own endeavour. And even though I know I'm an equal shareholder, I still get surprised when mum asks me what I think we should do in a certain situation. It's really cool owning an ice cream company.","Rowan Joyce, 52, runs South Street Coffee Shop in Isleworth, Middlesex .

Victor, a 16-year-old, half-tonne bear who has lived at the Yorkshire Wildlife Park in Doncaster since August has now been joined by younger male Pixel. The park said Pixel is 14 years younger and a third of the size of his new compound-mate. Pixel (pictured) a two-year-old polar bear from a zoo just outside Eindhoven in the Netherlands has arrived at the Yorkshire Wildlife Park in Doncaster, where he joins resident 16-year-old polar bear Victor . On Monday, Pixel was transported in a specialist lorry to Rotterdam for the overnight ferry trip to Hull . Once Pixel is settled the park plans to introduce him to Victor as soon as possible . Pixel soon made himself at home in his enclosure and immediately began exploring his new surroundings . 'Male polar bears will leave their mothers at approximately two years old,' said Animal Development Manager Simon Marsh. 'This means it is quite natural for Pixel to wander and find other males to hang around with. 'Pixel is very playful and finds everything interesting and will be sure to keep Victor and the visitors entertained.' The park said Pixel, who may one day be part of the European Breeding Programme, was brought to YWP from a zoo outside Eindhoven in the Netherlands in an operation this week. Pixel arrived at the park yesterday morning (pictured) before being released in the polar enclosure . Polar bears are a species that are increasingly being threatened in their native habitat . On Monday he was transported in a specialist lorry to Rotterdam for the overnight ferry trip to Hull, arriving at the South Yorkshire park on yesterday morning. Mr Marsh said Victor, who weighs 480kg, gave a roar when he realised there was an new arrival at Project Polar, the park's purpose-built 10 acre polar bear reserve. He said: 'Victor was immediately on his guard when he realised another polar bear was there. But after a roar or two he settled down. Once released in the enclosure Pixel immediately took a dip following his long journey from the Netherlands . To his obvious delight the polar bear caught a fish in the large pond within his enclosure . 'Once Pixel is settled in the plan will be to introduce them together as soon as possible. Pixel is going to look so small compared to big old Victor.' Mr Marsh added: 'Polar bears are an iconic species that are increasingly threatened in their native habitat and we need to fight their cause. 'Their native sea ice is disappearing due to climate change but we still have a chance to do something about it and at Project Polar we can share with visitors how they can help. 'It is also vital that we understand how to care for these bears appropriately in captivity and provide for their needs. 'The initial research into Victor has been extremely encouraging and Pixel's arrival is a bonus.' Pixel appears very pleased with himself as he returns his catch to the bank before eating it .

185b0e49d27f8052ceb4611c4ef66c88ff6bbc10,"Don't get me wrong, I am not Marouane Fellaini’s biggest fan, but if Manchester United are to win on Sunday then he is going to have a big role to play. You would never have believed at the start of the season that he would become United’s go-to man but he has knuckled down, worked hard and is now one of Louis van Gaal’s most effective players. Here’s why... TARGET MAN . 2,251 - Burnley . 2,241 - QPR . 2,226 - Manchester United . United have played the third-most long balls this season, so this is not the skilful, free-flowing team of previous years. But with Fellaini it is an effective tactic. He has gone up for 115 aerial duels this season — far more than any other United man — and Crystal Palace’s Mile Jedinak is the only midfielder to win more headers per game. His power in the air is vital for providing knock-downs for the likes of Wayne Rooney and Juan Mata to collect. Liverpool must also track his runs into the box because United will try to find him as often as they can. Marouane Fellaini, pictured during training, has gone up for 115 aerial duels this season . Fellaini is a powerful player that has become a key part of Louis van Gaal's United team this season . POWER PLAY . One thing is for sure with Fellaini, you know you’re in a game with him. Martin Skrtel, Emre Can and Mamadou Sakho are big, physical players but they will have a battle on their hands. Fellaini gives away on average 2.1 free-kicks per game — that’s the fifth-highest rate in the league and shows you what a fighter he is. It’s not pretty, but it unsettles defences. United midfielder Fellaini will not be afraid to get physical with Liverpool's players at Anfield . TOUCH OF CLASS . Fellaini's game is not all about power. Like Peter Crouch, he’s portrayed as a bit of a Lurch when actually his technique is good. Just look at that controlled finish with his left foot to open the scoring against Tottenham. He might not be the creative genius to win United titles, but he has become a useful weapon for Van Gaal. Fellaini lets rip a shot with his left foot as he makes it 1-0 against Tottenham Hotspur at Old Trafford . Fellaini has been a useful weapon for Van Gaal and was on form against Tottenham in United's 3-0 win . Fellaini celebrates his goal for United in this brilliant photograph taken by Sportsmail's Ian Hodgson . FORWARD THINKING . It was painful viewing last season seeing Fellaini play in a deep midfield role. David Moyes wanted him as protection for his defence, but Fellaini turns like a cruise liner and it was easy for teams to press him. Playing further forward, it doesn’t matter if he loses possession as there is no immediate danger and he can provide an attacking threat of his own. Fellaini has been allowed to play further forward for United under Van Gaal, unlike under David Moyes . ELBOW ROOM . Fellaini is a real nuisance player. He’s like a daddy longlegs — all arms and legs as he wrestles and grapples to get himself into position. He gets his elbows up high, which makes him very difficult to mark, and it’s hard to get players around him. It’s that physicality that would make me tempted to start Steven Gerrard on Sunday. Not for sentimental reasons, but because he would offer a vital shield against Fellaini’s threat. Head and shoulders: Fellaini is Van Gaal’s key player . Fellaini has become Van Gaal's key player and he will likely be a nuisance for Liverpool on Sunday .","Manchester United face rivals Liverpool at Anfield on Sunday .

47e7ea3c1b445e4afcfb20f9eab663e38875b800,"A high-flying academic who travels the world as a Government adviser is set to be deported from Britain under 'barmy' new visa laws - because she is out of the country more than 180 days a year. Dr Miwa Hirono, 38, is originally from Japan but has been living in the UK since becoming a lecturer at the University of Nottingham seven years ago. The world-renowned academic's work - which helps the UK Government to set foreign policy - requires her to spend long spells working in China and Africa. Set to be deported: Miwa Hirono with her husband, Peter Trebilco, 61, and one-year-old son Tada, must leave Britain under 'barmy' new visa laws . In 2009 and 2010 she spent around 200 days abroad researching China's foreign peacekeeping and humanitarian operations. But Home Office immigration laws now state that people working in the UK on a migrant visa cannot be out of the country for more than 180 days each year. And despite the fact Dr Hirono does research for a Government-funded organisation and her baby son was born in Britain, the Home Office has decided to deport her. Her university colleagues have slammed the decision as 'vindictive and bone-headed' but the Home Office has refused to back down. Today, Dr Hirono, who lives in Beeston, Notts., with her husband Peter Trebilco, 61, and their one-year-old son Tada, said: 'It came as a massive, utter shock. 'My Australian husband quit his job to join me in the UK as a family. I bought a house in Beeston two years ago and gave birth to my son here. 'I have my life here, everything is here but I have to give up everything. Battle: Dr Hirono's university colleagues have slammed the decision as 'vindictive and bone-headed' 'It is idiocy. The Government funded my research and now they are penalising me for hard work and contributing to their policies. 'I have one published paper which is uploaded on the UK embassy in Beijing's website. They changed the visa rule in 2012 and have applied it retrospectively to my travel in 2009 and 2010. 'What has happened to me is absolutely wrong and everyone understands my point except the Home Office. 'I thought this was a democratic country with natural justice but it doesn't seem that way.' Dr Hirono, an expert in international relations, has decided not to appeal the decision because the cost of the process would make it 'impractical'. Instead she has taken a job at a university in Kyoto, Japan, and the family are leaving the UK on March 29. Her husband Peter said the Home Office decision has caused the family to uproot their whole life. Left with no choice: Dr Hirono, an expert in international relations, has decided not to appeal the decision because the cost of the process would make it 'impractical' He added: 'It tears at your heart because we've gone to great lengths to make good friends in the neighbourhood and we're very supportive and contribute to the community. 'We're having to tear our son out of nursery, give up a home we've established, with neighbours we're very fond of, and none of that is our doing. 'It's an inflexibility - the law does not have the capacity to deal with individual situations. It's our whole life.' Dr Hirono came to the University of Nottingham in 2008 on a prestigious five-year Research Council UK fellowship, which then became a permanent role. But when applying to extend her visa last March, she was banned and told she would be deported because of the foreign travel aspect of her job. University bosses even wrote to the Home Office to tell officials that the trips were part of her job. In December, Dr Hirono won an appeal against the Home Office with a judge suggesting it would not be in the national interest to deport someone who had 'made a significant and profound contribution to the academic framework of higher education in this country'. But that ruling was later overturned and immigration bosses confiscated the family's passports a year ago. Professor Mathew Humphrey said Dr Hirono's research had had a significant impact on policy towards China, including on the UK's co-operation programme with the country. Unsympathetic: Government officials told her she could keep in touch with friends in the UK via skype after ruling her private life should be given 'little weight' Philip Cowley, professor of parliamentary government at the university, said: 'It is pure madness for the government to be driving out an expert on what is probably the most important foreign policy challenge of the next decade. 'Both from a human perspective and from the interests of the UK, this is indefensible.' Dr Hirono's local MP, Anna Soubry, even wrote to Home Secretary Theresa May asking her to consider the decision, but no action was taken. A Home Office spokesperson said: 'Ms Hirono's application for indefinite leave to remain was refused in July 2014 because she had spent more than 180 days outside the UK.' Government officials told her she could keep in touch with friends in the UK via skype after ruling her private life should be given 'little weight'. Dr Hirono said she believes her case will have a wider impact on the UK's ability to hire foreign professionals. She added: 'This could mean the UK loses its capacity to hire any foreign professional on a permanent basis. 'Who would want to stop their live elsewhere and move everything to the UK only to be kicked out after five years.'","Dr Miwa Hirono has been a lecturer at University of Nottingham for 7 years .

3a713e68e18993f30b03d2f171aeea425abaa8b0,"A bank worker tried to murder his topless masseuse girlfriend after he quit his job to start a business with her but then became jealous when a man smiled at her in a club. Amish Kansagra opened a massage parlour with his Polish lover Anna Imporowicz, but he was angry that she attracted interest from other men, including her ex-boyfriend. The couple fell out when a man smiled at Miss Imporowicz in a salsa club - and the next day Kansagra turned up at her home and stabbed her in the throat, saying: 'You will die today.' He was today convicted of attempted murder at Kingston-upon-Thames Crown Court, after a jury heard he had 'eyes like the devil' during his violent rampage. Attack: Amish Kansagra, left, tried to murder his masseuse girlfriend Anna Imporowicz, right . Judge Susan Tapping said that Kansagra, 28, would face a 'lengthy sentence' for the crime after being found guilty. The couple first started dating when Kansagra became a regular client of Miss Imporowicz, 35, who would give massages to naked customers while she was topless or wearing skimpy underwear. He left his job at a bank and opened a massage parlour with her in Ealing, west London, but their relationship fell apart last June after the incident in a Holborn salsa club. The court heard that the pair went home together that night, but Kansagra shoved Miss Imporowicz against a fridge, destroyed her phone and laptop and posted a picture of her on Facebook with the caption: 'I'm a prostitute and proud of it.' The next day, he turned up at her house in nearby Brentford armed with a knife which he had taken from the massage parlour. Victim: Miss Imporowicz met the defendant because he was a massage customer of hers . Prosecutor Julian Jones told the jury: 'She saw Amish with the knife in his hand and he shut the kitchen window and put the knife to her throat and said, ""You've made the wrong decision. You will die today."" 'He was trying to stab her neck and she felt him cut her neck and and she saw her blood and fell to the floor saying, ""I love you. Don't do this."" 'She described him as having gritted teeth and eyes like the devil, and he cut her neck again, harder and deeper, and used the tip of the knife to cut her gum.' Miss Imporowicz tried to flee out of the front door, but was pulled back by the defendant, Mr Jones continued. 'He still had the knife in one hand and the other hand around her neck and stabbed her in the side. 'She escaped via a window and while she had one leg out Amish tried to stab her everywhere.' A retired nurse came to her aid, and as Kansagra fled the scene he told witnesses that Miss Imporowicz had inflicted the horrific injuries on himself. The defendant initially ran away to Manchester, but he later turned himself in to police and claimed not to remember anything thanks to a three-day vodka binge. 'He said she was the first person he had ever loved and that there was something inside him,' the prosecutor said. 'He recalled stabbing Anna in the neck and seeing the blood and confirmed he was not acting in self-defence.' Kansagra was convicted by the jury of one count of attempted murder, but was found not guilty of assaulting Miss Imporowicz. Before the trial he pleaded guilty to causing criminal damage, possessing a bladed article and inflicting grievous bodily harm with intent. Kansagra was remanded in custody for sentencing on March 19.","Amish Kansagra, 28, met Anna Imporowicz when he became a customer of hers at topless massage parlour .

a1bc1f5f5c20618577898f7be4d94f2f007bedb5,"Sanaa, Yemen (CNN)The U.S. military is in the process of evacuating about 100 Special Operations forces members from the Al Anad airbase in Yemen due to that country's deteriorating security situation, sources in the region familiar with the situation told CNN. Those being evacuated are the last American troops stationed in the Arab nation, which is home to al Qaeda in the Arabian Peninsula, the terrorist group also known as AQAP. The United States closed its embassy in Sanaa last month, after Houthi rebels took over the Yemeni capital. And hundreds of al Qaeda members escaped two Yemeni prisons Thursday and Friday, raising further security questions. For years, the U.S. military has worked closely with Yemen's government to go after AQAP, together carrying out numerous attacks like the 2011 drone strike that killed prominent al Qaeda figure Anwar al-Awlaki. And U.S. President Barack Obama has hailed this cooperation as a pillar in his anti-terrorism campaign. ""Yemen has never been a perfect democracy or a island of stability,"" Obama said in January, promoting the policy of ""partnering and intelligence-sharing with that local government"" as the best approach in a bad situation. ""The alternative would be for us to play whack-a-mole every time there is a terrorist actor inside of any given country,"" the President said. But while there have been drone strikes as recently as last month, these cooperative efforts have been hampered by Yemen's growing difficulty in maintaining unity and peace. These include the rise of the Houthis, their battles with forces loyal to ousted President Abdu Rabu Mansour Hadi and the presence of not only al Qaeda fighters but other militants. On Friday, for instance, ISIS purportedly claimed responsibility for bombings at two mosques in Sanaa what, if true, would mark that group's first large-scale attack in Yemen. The claim came in a statement posted on a site that previously carried ISIS proclamations, but couldn't be immediately authenticated by CNN. Those blasts killed at least 137 people and wounded 357 others, according to Yemen's state-run Saba news agency. While ISIS and al Qaeda are both Sunni groups that espouse extreme versions of Islam and violent opposition to the West, that doesn't mean they will be working together anytime soon. In fact, AQAP strongly rebuked ISIS in a video released in November, characterizing its leader Abu Bakr al-Baghdadi's declaration of an Islamic caliphate as illegitimate. More than anything, the idea of the group calling itself the Islamic State violently flexing its muscles speaks to the chaotic situation there. With no one really in control, that means numerous groups -- including those with a history of killing civilians and lashing out at the West -- have been more room to operate and a better chance potentially to take over. Meanwhile, the main players for control of Yemen's government -- those siding with Hadi, who still claims to be president after being deposed earlier this year, and the Houthis, a minority group that's strongest in the northern part of the country -- remain very much at odds. Just two days ago, a Yemeni jet commanded by the capital's Houthi conquerors fired missiles at a palace housing Hadi in the port city of Aden. No one was injured, but the direct strike nonetheless marked an escalation in the deadly fighting between the two sides. The airstrikes came on the same day opposing Yemeni military forces -- some under the Houthis, others led by officers loyal to Hadi -- battled in Aden, said Aden Gov. AbdulAziz Hobtour. At least 13 people died and 21 others were injured in those clashes, according to Hobtour. Hadi took to the airwaves of Adan TV, a station he recently started, on Saturday in his first televised speech since escaping house arrest. He called on all political factions to take part in upcoming talks in the Saudi capital of Riyadh, condemning the Aden strike and urging Yemeni troops to refuse orders from Houthi officials. Hadi tied the Houthis to Iran, which he was said supported the ""coup"" that led to his departure from Aden. ""The Iranian agenda of the Houthis will not last,"" he said. Needless to say, the Houthis aren't convinced. Mohammed Al Bukhaiti, a top member of the Houthi Political Council, said Hadi's speech won't help Yemen reach a peaceful resolution and accused him of reneging on a deal last September to transfer power. ""We blame Hadi for not implementing this deal that drew the road map that would have solved Yemen's ongoing crises,"" Al Bukhaiti said. ""Hadi will be held responsible for the country's failures and that chaos that could follow."" Journalist Hakim Almasmari reported from Sanaa, and CNN's Greg Botelho reported and wrote from Atlanta.","Yemen's deposed president lashes out at Houthi rebels in a speech .

aee16af5d39c1be6010be76913a186601c2c339a,"If there was a textbook on Jose Mourinho’s management style, the antics of Chelsea’s players against Paris Saint-Germain would be page one. Surrounding the referee, complaining about decisions, elbows, and intimidation. Save for the poor result, it had all the hallmarks of a Mourinho classic. However, if the histrionics start to outweigh performances the Portuguese has a habit of losing favour fast. It’s what killed his reign at Real Madrid. Jose Mourinho shows his frustrations during Chelsea's match against PSG on Wednesday night . Chelsea players surround referee Bjorn Kuipers and demand a red card is shown to Zlatan Ibrahimovic . Ibrahimovic (right) gets up as nine Chelsea players surround him and the referee after the incident . One of the battles Mourinho fought at Real was with the club’s own match delegate Miguel Porlan. ‘Chendo’, as he is known to everyone, played for over a decade at right-back for Madrid before continuing to serve the club after hanging up his boots. As part of the staff allowed to sit on the bench during games alongside goalkeeping coach Silvino Louro, fitness coach Rui Faria, and Mourinho’s No 2 and current Middlesbrough manager Aitor Karanka, Chendo soon became part of the systematic applying of pressure on the fourth official. It was understood that Mourinho liked his assistants to rotate the badgering of match officials so to limit the likelihood any one individual would be sent off. Chendo, who respected – and was respected by – Mourinho, thought the tactic was below a club like Real Madrid. Spanish daily El Pais claimed he told his manager as much saying: ‘We don’t do that kind of thing here’, and also suggested it was common knowledge among the players that Chendo hated the role so much he would often approach the fourth official and appear to remonstrate with him when really he was just asking him if he had the time, or if knew what time Madrid’s big department store El Corte Inglés opened in the morning. Mourinho (centre) talks with Real Madrid delegate Miguel 'Chendo' Porlan during a La Liga match in 2010 . Nemanja Matic (centre) appeals to the referee following Ibrahimovic's tackle on Oscar during the first half . Chelsea players later look dejected as they are knocked out of the Champions League round of 16 . Mourinho has always believed matches are won not just by the eleven on the pitch but by everyone at the club. And neither are they just won with football. If the opposition can be intimidated and bullied – and if that affects their ability to play – then that serves the end-game goal of victory. Mourinho’s ‘us against them’ battle plan at Madrid lasted three years. It left many at the club burned-out and almost relieved when it was replaced by the calm bought by Carlo Ancelotti, but it cannot be said that it did not bring trophies. It’s true that he never reached the Champions League final at the club but he did win the Spanish Cup in his first season and La Liga in his second. That might have been small fare in any other era but against the best Barcelona team in history it can’t be seen that way. The third season at the Bernabeu that produced no trophies came when there were perhaps more dissenting voices inside the dressing room than there were players prepared to do it Jose’s way. The key to Mourinho’s success is that everybody rows to the same rhythm – once a couple of galley members have downed oars there are problems. Mourinho (right) argues with the referee as Cristiano Ronaldo (left) looks on during a match in April 2013 . Real Madrid players look on as Mourinho (left) is involved in an argument with the referee during the 2011 Champions League semi-final against Barcelona . On the pitch players often had to curtail their instincts to try to just out-play the opposition by surrendering to an overall plan to out-strategize them too. The beginnings of the fall-outs with Iker Casillas and Sergio Ramos came because they believed, having won the World Cup with Spain, they could match Barcelona for football. Others, such as Xabi Alonso, sided with Mourinho believing that they would never out-play Pep Guardiola’s team and they had to be cleverer. Part of Mourinho’s belief that it would take more than just football to beat Barca came from his experience at Inter. They beat Guardiola’s Barcelona in the semi-finals of the Champions League on their way to beating Bayern Munich in the final but they did it with their centre-forward at full-back as an early sending off for Thiago Motta left them with most of the game having to play with 10 men. His victory jig on the pitch that night interrupted only by the Nou Camp sprinklers and Victor Valdes trying to usher him off the pitch is one of the images of his career and it set the tone for his time at Madrid but it didn’t always work. In Mourinho’s first season, and just after one of his greatest triumphs with Real beating Barca in the Copa del Rey final 1-0 courtesy of a goal from Cristiano Ronaldo, Barcelona and Madrid were drawn together again in the semi-finals of the Champions League. Ronaldo (back) leaps high to score the winning goal in the 2011 Copa del Rey final against Barcelona . Real Madrid players celebrate with the trophy after winning La Liga in the season of 2011-12 . The players were flying believing that after their cup final success they now had the measure of Barcelona. But Mourinho thought otherwise and set his team up in the first leg at the Bernabeu to not lose. They would defend stubbornly and in numbers and frustrate Barcelona before going for them in the latter stages of the match. If they scored a late goal to put them ahead in the tie then perfect; if not then a 0-0 would be a good result to take back to the Nou Camp where without an away goal and bound to go on the attack, Barca would leave themselves open on the break. Ronaldo was one of the dissenters famously putting his hands on his hips and looking to the heavens when during one period of the first half he found himself the only man pressing Barcelona’s defenders. The rest were obeying orders to sit back and not be drawn out of position. Ronaldo looks dejected as he leaves the field after defeat by Barcelona in the Champions League in 2011 . The plan may well have worked to perfection but Pepe was sent off in the second half after clashing with Dani Alves and against 10 men Messi scored twice to leave Real with no chance in the second leg. Mourinho recovered his players’ faith and winning the league the following season was his greatest achievement in Spain. Opinion is still divided over his legacy. One television station in Spain suggested this week that Mourinho was among three candidates to replace Ancelotti along with Zinedine Zidane and Jurgen Klopp. Others shook their heads at the incredulity of the idea he will ever return. The purists tut-tutted their way through that league winning campaign shaking their heads at those lightning counter-attacks so brutally effective but lacking the refinery of Barcelona’s 20-pass moves to goal. But it worked because Madrid and Mourinho won. It’s when it no longer works - as it didn’t for Chelsea on Wednesday - is it really called into question.","Chelsea were knocked out of the Champions League last-16 by PSG .

138ad5121f1f62ffd15b7bb515c6f7a7371cb6c2,"Return: Comedienne Tracey Ullman is to comeback to BBC with six-episode sketch show . She made her fortune when her career took off in the US and now comedienne Tracey Ullman is set to mark her UK comeback - with a six-episode of her sketch show on BBC1 . Worth an estimated £75million, the mother-of-two is a far cry from the star who was introduced to the public in Three of a Kind and A Kick Up the EIghties. And thanks to The Tracey Ullman show, she became one of the few British acts to break the American market. Also a Hollywood actress, Miss Ullman said yesterday the BBC had transformed since her original stint at the Corporation. She said: ‘It’s a privilege to be doing this. I still feel as inspired to inhabit people as I did when I was six, standing on the windowsill in my mother’s bedroom, putting on a show. ‘The BBC has changed a bit since the last time I worked here, when it was all men in bow ties who had completed National Service. Now there are a lot more women. Great ones. 'The important things haven’t changed, though. The BBC still provides an environment that allows you to the freedom to create the best shows possible.’ Shane Allen, head of comedy at the BBC, called Miss Ullman’s return to BBC1 a ‘homecoming’ and said: ‘We’ve got Tracey Ullman returning to our screens to do what she does brilliantly – a multi-character sketch show. 'She’s won 7 Emmys for her work and she’s always been the one who got away for British comedy, a huge talent and it’s an enormous privilege to welcome her back to the BBC.’ A source at the BBC added: ‘Tracey is a huge talent who has the comedy world at her feet so for her to choose to come back to the BBC feels like a real coup for the corporation. Before heading across the Atlantic, she had built a career on the stage and then found fame on television among a generation of comics that included Lenny Henry, Rik Mayall, Robbie Coltrane and David Copperfield. But it was not enough for Miss Ullman, who headed to across the Atlantic to forge a new career. With The Tracey Ullman Show in the late 1980s, she became one of the few British acts to successfully break the American market and the first foreign-born female comedian to do so. The variety show not only won a string of top awards, including a Golden Globe, but also gave cartoon The Simpsons its first chance of television as a regular segment on the programme. She is now bringing the programme to the BBC as part of its new comedy line-up, announced yesterday. Other highlights include The Ronnie Barker Comedy Lecture, in which a big comedy name – yet to be announced – will discuss the role the art form has in a free society. Original: The Simpsons Family as they first appeared on the Tracey Ullman Show . Other BBC stalwarts will be making their usual appearances. A programme has been commissioned to mark the 25-year partnership of Harry Enfield, 53, and Paul Whitehouse, 56, and there will also be new offerings from Rory Bremner, 53, and Death in Paradise star Ben Miller, 49. As well as acting, Miss Ullman has appeared in Hollywood films such as The Corpse Bride and Into the Woods, and made her fortune flipping high-value homes in Los Angeles with her husband, Allan McKeown. The Award-winning producer of his wife’s show Tracey Takes On…, Mr McKeown died on Christmas Eve 2013 at the age of 67 from prostate cancer, three days before the couple’s thirtieth wedding anniversary. They had two children, Johnny McKeown, 26, who has followed in his mother’s footsteps to become an actor, and Mabel, 28, who is a manager at charity International Medical Corps and previously worked for Labour’s deputy leader Harriet Harman. She unsuccessful sought selection as the Labour candidate for the Neath constituency, in Wales, at this year’s general election. Early days: Tracey Ullman (middle) with comedian David Copperfield (left) and Lenny Henry with their awards for television programme 'Three of a kind' at the Variety club awards in 1984 . This political inclination towards left-wing politics runs in the family as Miss Ullman is a known Labour supporter and is friends with the party’s former leader Neil Kinnock. While she has gone on to such stellar success, Miss Ullman did not have an easy start to life. She was born in Slough in 1959, to a middle class family. She was the youngest of two daughter born to Polish émigré Anthony Ullman. Mr Ullman was a key figure in the local Eastern European community and sold suits made by his English seamstress wife Dorin. She lost her father at the age of six when he collapsed and died from a heart attack while reading her a bedtime story. His death saw the family’s fortunes change and they moved to Hackbridge, southwest London, where her mother was forced to work a series of odd-jobs to make ends meet. She has previously said of the loss: ‘After he died, our fortunes came and went because Mum couldn’t speak Polish and had to give up the business. 'When I meet other girls who lost their fathers when they were young, I really relate to them. You become independent quickly; I could cope with anything because of that terrible loss.’ Despite struggling for money, Miss Ullman has said her mother would only ever refer to the family as middle class out of a sense of pride and because ‘we had money at one time.’ Mrs Ullman then had an unhappy second marriage and, after it ended, the family moved around the country several times. Miss Ullman always had dreams of performing and would put on shows for her mother with her sister Patti. At 13, she visited a clairvoyant who predicted she would find fame in America. She won a scholarship to respected stage school Italia Conti and, aged 16, she landed her first job dancing in Berlin. The following year she was performing in a show in Blackpool alongside Les Dawson. She said: ‘He was terrific. He had a great brain and he liked smart women. I used to drink scotch and smoke cigarettes with him in his dressing room. ' And he was the first person to say to me: `You know, you’re very funny. You should do more comedy. You won’t be a dancer for ever.’ I remember taking that very seriously.’ She went on to have a short-lived career as a pop singer before marrying Mr McKeown, 15 years her senior, in 1983. A successful producer with interests in Los Angeles as well as London, They moved into Steven Spielberg’s old house in California when she was pregnant with Mabel and she was happy to try her hand at comedy in America.","Found fame alongside comics including Rik Mayall and Lenny Henry .

Joseph Defillipo from Scandinavian Middle School in Fresno, California, was recorded by a student's cellphone, saying: 'I just don't like the black kids.' Defillipo had been in the middle of a discussion with several students about who he didn't like at the school. The 20-second clip cuts off after the teacher's racially-insensitive comment. The vice principal has taught in the district for 18 years and has been at the middle school since 2010. The video was posted to YouTube on Friday where it has been watched more than 4,000 times. It was brought to the school's attention by a parent of the student involved. Scandinavian Middle School refused to comment when contacted by Daily Mail Online on Wednesday. Daily Mail Online was also waiting on a comment from the school district. In a statement to Daily Mail Online on Wednesday the school said Defillipo had been put on paid administrative leave while an third-party, external investigation took place. A school statement read: 'Fresno Unified takes great pride in providing a positive learning environment for all students and staff. The interaction between the Scandinavian student and our employee has been brought to our attention and we are conducting an investigation. 'Fresno Unified takes this matter very seriously and we will take any necessary actions pending the results. During our investigation, and as a matter of practice, the employee is on paid administrative leave.' Several parents whose children attend Scandinavian Middle School told The Fresno Bee that they want Defillipo fired. A group of former students gathered outside the school premises on Tuesday to protest, chanting: 'I love black people' and 'black power'. Around 10 per cent of students at Scandinavian Middle School are black, The Fresno Bee reported. The vice principal earns around $87,000 a year, according to public records. The YouTube video attracted a number of comments, both attacking and in defense of the senior teacher. One commenter, Kevin Hill, wrote: 'I'd withhold any judgment until the rest of the video comes out. First, he was talking to black mids [sic], most likely joking, inappropriate, yeah but not racist. Second, the way the video cuts immediately out indicates that there was more said which in context would've shown he was joking.' Alyssa Hochstetler wrote: 'why would he say that? im so glad i left that school.'

acadc5459d4bfe6bb03d397affd267e78d94b9a6,"Researchers studying nature have turned to a new frontier they say could be more diverse than anmost anywhere else - homes. They say indoor spaces could be the fastest growing biome, a word used to describe the different realms of life on Earth. Researchers estimate that the indoor biome makes up about 0.5 percent of ice-free land, or about 247,000 square miles, almost the size of Texas. The various organisms living in homes and other indoor spaces rarely has been researched, with sparse studies of rodents and German cockroaches, researchers say. A study of 40 houses in North Carolina used genomic technologies to document the inhabitants. It found more than 8,000 bacterial and archaeal taxa. Another study of 50 houses in the same state described more than 750 types of arthropods, including insects and spiders . An examination of 11 houses in California found a great variety of fungus among us. A review paper published March 19 in the journal Trends in Ecology and Evolution serves as a call for research in the emerging field of indoor biome ecology and evolution. The various organisms living in homes and other indoor spaces rarely has been researched, with sparse studies of rodents and German cockroaches, for example, from the pest management field, or public health perspectives on microbes. The paper came out of a 2013 workshop that included the evolutionary biology of the built environment, which included evolutionary, microbial and plant biologists, entomologists, architects, scientists who study better building design, and others. 'People have this picture that there are only a few insect species and microbial species eating human scrap,' said Laura Martin of Cornell, the paper's first author. 'But given the number of species found indoors, it is likely there's a lot more going on that we don't know about.' A study of 40 houses in North Carolina used genomic technologies to document more than 8,000 bacterial and archaeal taxa; another study of 50 houses in the same state described more than 750 types of arthropods, including insects and spiders; and an examination of 11 houses in California found a great variety of fungus among us. Researchers estimate that the indoor biome makes up about 0.5 percent of ice-free land, or about 247,000 square miles, almost the size of Texas. 'I've been noticing more species inside my house since I went to this working group,' Martin said, referring to the 2013 workshop. Co-author Robert Dunn, of North Carolina State University, discovered a species of parasitic wasp that lays its eggs inside cockroaches in his house. 'The radical diversity in abiotic environments, such as in water heaters, freezers and on kitchen counters, is vast and could parallel microclimates found on forest floors,' said Martin. The paper notes that the first human houses date back 20,000 years and that today's indoor environments most closely resemble caves. The emerging field also holds potential for studying rapid evolution, as the development of human-built environments has been recent. Madagascar Hissing Cockroaches: Researchers called for more research into pests, saying the home was an untapped resource. Close up of a bedbug on skin.'People have this picture that there are only a few insect species and microbial species eating human scrap,' said Laura Martin, the paper's first author and a graduate student in the field of natural resources. Researchers say they have many questions regarding the indoor evolution -  such as whether species found indoors were pre-adapted to indoor environments or whether they have adapted to them; and how the indoors might drive the evolution of new species. They also hope to compare species in Alaska, for example, with species in Texas; whether outdoor environments determine what happens indoors; which indoor species are healthful to have; and how home design can contribute to health and indoor species compositions. 'We are interested in reframing the dialogue away from what gross or dangerous pests live in houses to what biodiversity exists in houses,' Martin said.","Researchers say homes are a hotbed of undiscovered species .

At the beginning of the interview the politician describes herself as a 'relatable woman on a couch'. Scroll down for video . Mimick: During the opening of the show the former Secretary of State Hillary Clinton, played by Kate McKinnon, speaks about allegations she used a private email account to conduct state business . Speaking to the camera: At the beginning of the interview she describes herself as a 'relateable woman on a couch' before revealing the content of the emails . Speaking about the release of the emails, following pressure from her opponents and the media, she says: 'Go ahead, read them, you won't find squat. 'Those emails are as clean as a whistle. What did you think those emails said? ""Hey it's Hilary I really screwed up on Benghazi"".' Referencing her probable run for president, she also insists: 'There will be no mistakes in my rise to the top.' She then describes the nature of the content in the messages, suggesting they will either by 'fun woman talk' or 'mature romance' - relating to correspondences with husband Bill. Giving an example, she reads out a fake email from a Gmail account sent by one of her friends: 'Hey Girl! Still up for a movie tonight? I heard that new Bradley Cooper one is hot. What do you want to see?' Fun woman talk: Giving an example of a message sent to her by one of her friends, she reads out a fake email from a Gmail account . Response: The former Secretary of State then replies by saying: 'I want to see myself as President of the United States of America' She then shows a mock reply which reads: 'I want to see myself as President of the United States of America.' Then, referring to what could be a saucy conversation with her former President husband, she reads an example: 'Dear Sir or Madam, Congratulations on your continued marital success. I would like to schedule a sit-down at your earliest convenience. Regards, The Office of Hillary Clinton.' Clinton goes on to say she would also open up her Netflix account and her private Instagram account - showing pictures of her on a roller coaster and a beach looking down at her phone. At the end of interview, she insists that she will get through the scandal, saying: 'I have survived everything that has been thrown at me. 'I shall rise from the ashes like a Phoenix, nay, Hilary Clinton.' Throughout she also refers to her potential candidacy for the presidential race by saying: 'If I run, who knows.' The scandal was also brought up later in the show during the Weekend Update segment where anchor Colin Jost said he felt sorry for whoever would have to sit through the 50,000 emails essentially sent by a 'grandma'.

1fe1b98dac4a8c6d2f7f909161af3fdd12582ea6,"David Cameron last night agreed to a single TV debate during the election campaign. The Prime Minister is expected to attend a seven-way session at the start of April, to be shown on ITV. The deal includes three other political programmes during the campaign in which some of the party leaders will take questions from the public or television interviewers. Scroll down for video . The Prime Minister has agreed to one seven-way debate hosted by ITV on April 2. He will also appear on a number of election specials – but without going head to head against Ed Miliband . Crucially, the BBC, Sky, ITV and Channel 4 appear to have blinked first and dropped their demand for a head-to-head clash between the PM and Ed Miliband. And they have backed down from their apparent threat to ‘empty chair’ the PM by holding debates with other leaders which he refused to attend. Labour appeared to deny the validity of the new proposal, insisting it still wanted three debates as originally proposed and accusing the PM of ‘running scared’ of a one-to-one with Mr Miliband. But, in an attempt to nail down the latest agreement, Mr Cameron said the other parties should accept it. ‘An offer’s been made, a deal’s been accepted, now the other parties must make clear that they accept this deal too, otherwise they will have to bear the responsibility,’ he said. ‘That’s what happened: a new offer put forward by the broadcasters, led by the BBC, to me, I accepted it, in full, on Saturday. So, I’m helping to make this debate go ahead. The other parties have got to stop running away from this and agree to the debate the broadcasters have now suggested.’ Labour leader Ed Miliband and the Deputy Prime Minister Nick Clegg would only face Mr Cameron in one seven-way debate . The latest proposal is thought to have been presented to the parties over the weekend. According to Tory sources, it includes four potential shows, the first in just nine days’ time on March 26. It will be a Channel 4 and Sky joint production hosted by Jeremy Paxman and featuring the PM and Mr Miliband, one after the other, facing questions from the host and a studio audience. The second show will be the only debate and will involve seven party leaders, with the addition of Nick Clegg, Nigel Farage, Green leader Natalie Bennett, Nicola Sturgeon of the SNP and the Plaid Cymru leader Leanne Wood. It will be broadcast by ITV on April 2. On April 16 the BBC is proposing a ‘challengers’ debate featuring the Greens, SNP, Ukip and Plaid. A week before polling day, on April 30, the BBC will host a 90-minute Question Time-style show with Mr Cameron, Mr Miliband and Mr Clegg appearing one after the other to face questions from a TV audience. This is a better deal for the Lib Dems, who complained that a head-to-head between the other two leaders would prevent them from defending their record in government. A Labour spokesman said: ‘No one should be fooled: David Cameron is still running scared of a head-to-head televised debate with Ed Miliband.’ n Mr Cameron poked fun at Ed Miliband for posing for TV cameras in a pokey kitchen that turned out to be one of two in his £2.5million London home. ‘I am not saying this to make a point but you shouldn’t pretend to be something you are not,’ the Prime Minister said. Showing off the open-plan kitchen he and wife Samantha had installed in Downing Street, he added: ‘We are lucky, we both work, we were able to spend our own money on this. ‘To me, the kitchen is where you spend all your time. It needs a sofa you can slump on, a table you can sit at, a kitchen you can cook in, a place children can do their homework.’ Under the broadcasters' latest proposal, the Tory, Lib Dem and Labour leaders would appear on Question Time hosted by David Dimbleby (left).

c8cb9772ab728642ff8a67fe24c31872d5cc1f06,"Hillary Rodham Clinton may be the Democratic Party's presidential front-runner, but the former secretary of state's poll numbers don't make her look the part. Her 'favorable' rating – a measure of how many Americans see her in a positive light – is now 'under water,' meaning that she has fewer fans than detractors. A CBS News poll released Thursday found that just 26 per cent see her favorably, compared with 37 per cent who don't. The rest, about one-third of those polled, haven't made up their minds. SCROLL DOWN FOR VIDEOS AND THE SURVEY RESULTS . UNDER WATER: Clinton's 'positive' poll numbers now trail her 'negatives' by 11 percentage points . READY TO REBOUND? Clinton's favorability numbers are only a few points higher today than when they hit an all-time low, according to a CBS poll – right after her memoir 'Hard Choices' hit bookshelves . Unsurprisingly, Clinton's 'unfavorable' numbers are high among Republicans, registering 78 per cent. Barely half of Democrats, though – just 55 per cent – say they hold favorable views of her. That number is down 8 points since November 2013. Across the entire voting spectrum, Clinton has lost 12 points of support in the intervening 16 months. Her high-water mark in the CBS poll came just two months after she took over the U.S. State Department in early 2009, when 58 per cent of Americans said they liked her. But the wheels fell off shortly after she left the Obama administration: When her memoir 'Hard Choices' his bookshelves, her favorability number bottomed out at 24 per cent. The most recent survey, conducted March 21-24, shows she's barely rebounded since then. WAITING IN THE WINGS: A deep field of Republicans including Wisconsin Gov. Scott Walker (left), former Florida Gov. Jeb Bush (center) and Texas Sen. Ted Cruz (right) is chomping at the bit and waiting for a chance to attack Clinton . There's bad news also for Clinton-backers who hope her 'email-gate' scandal has only temporarily poisoned the public perceptions. Two-thirds of those surveyed said the brewing scandal had no impact on their opinion, giving her precious little ground to make up even if the controversy fades. In addition to Clinton's use of a private, unaudited email server for all her messages while she was the Obama administration's top diplomat, she continues to be dogged by accusations that her family foundation accepted millions of dollars from foreign governments during the same timeframe. CBS pollsters did not ask whether that embarrassing news had an impact on how Americans see her. But her responses to the email kerfuffle have produced mixed results. Americans appear evenly divided over whether Clinton's explanations satisfied their concerns. Forty-two per cent said yes, while 40 per cent said no. LONG MEMORY: Some part of voters' negative impressions of Mrs. Clinton may harken back to her time as first lady . Thirty-eight per cent said they believe Clinton kept the State Department out of the loop on her emails principally to shield work-related communications from the public. Forty-nine percent believed her claim that she did it out of 'convenience.' On balance, Clinton's biggest hurdle may be her own words, stretching back into the 1990s when she was America's first lady. Forty-seven per cent of the people CBS polled said they don't believe she is 'honest and trustworthy' – 5 per cent more than the number who came down on Mrs. Clinton's side.

Downing Street was struggling to contain the fallout from the Prime Minister’s extraordinary announcement that May’s general election will be his last. Friends dismissed rumours that Mr Cameron’s wife, Samantha, had asked him to make clear he would not seek a third term if re-elected, while Mr Cameron insisted he had simply given a ‘straight answer to a straight question’ and that most people would think that was a ‘sensible’ thing to do. Scroll down for video . Prime Minister David Cameron (pictured) was forced to defend his decision to announce a sell-by date on his premiership yesterday as senior Tories accused him of trying to anoint George Osborne as his successor . As Labour accused him of ‘arrogance’ for discussing a third election before he wins a second, he insisted he was ‘taking absolutely nothing for granted’. ‘My entire focus is on the next 44 days and the general election that will decide which team runs the country for the next five years,’ Mr Cameron said. But senior MPs warned that pre-announcing a departure before the 2020 election would inevitably undermine his authority if he remained in No 10. It came as Mr Cameron was reminded of his comments to Tony Blair when the former premier announced he was handing over the reins to then-Chancellor Gordon Brown mid-term. ‘Your authority is draining away,’ he told Mr Blair in the Commons in January 2007. ‘The Government can’t plan. Ministers are treading water. They are all waiting for the Chancellor and not listening to you.’ One former shadow minister said that by indicating he will depart in the next Parliament, Mr Cameron appeared to be seeking to head off moves to oust him on May 8 if he falls short of a Commons majority and tries to lead another coalition or a minority government. David Cameron has revealed he will stand down as Prime Minister before 2020 if he wins the next election . Senior MPs warned that pre-announcing a departure before the 2020 election would inevitably undermine his authority if he remained in No 10. Pictured: David Cameron visits a butchers in his Oxfordshire constituency . ‘He may think it will be harder for the men in the grey suits to come knocking when he has said he won’t be going on and on,’ the MP said. ‘The truth is he won’t last five minutes, let alone five years, if he loses again.’ There was particular consternation that Mr Cameron effectively fired the starting gun on a leadership contest by naming three potential successors: Home Secretary Theresa May, London Mayor Boris Johnson and Mr Osborne, the Chancellor. Mrs May and Mr Johnson have long been seen the leading rivals to be the next Tory leader, but Mr Cameron sparked frenzied speculation at Westminster by including his name of Mr Osborne, his closest ally. Since his unpopular Budget of 2012, Mr Osborne’s leadership prospects have been discounted by many. Boris Johnson . Boris Johnson is the favourite among voters to succeed David Cameron, a poll reveals today. But the London Mayor repeatedly refused to say whether he would join a leadership contest. Chancellor George Osborne is thought to be the Prime Minister’s preference to be his successor. But in a ComRes survey for the Daily Mail, Mr Johnson was backed by 31 per cent of voters, ahead of Theresa May on 17 per cent and Mr Osborne on 12 per cent. Support for the Mayor among Tory voters was particularly strong – 36 per cent said he would make the best prime minister, Mr Osborne was on 25 per cent and Mrs May on 18 per cent. Mr Johnson’s strongest backing was among Ukip supporters, at 44 per cent – suggesting he would do the best job of regaining support from the Eurosceptic party. He was also backed by 32 per cent of Labour voters, ahead of Mrs May on 19 per cent, and the Chancellor on 7 per cent. But in an LBC Radio interview yesterday, Mr Johnson dodged questions about his ambitions more than a dozen times. He is bidding to return as an MP in May in the safe seat of Uxbridge, but claimed Mr Cameron’s intervention was ‘no big deal’. ‘All he’s saying is I think obvious and common sense … he doesn’t want to go on and on and on like Mrs Thatcher,’ the Mayor said. ‘To say he’s arrogant or presumptuous to rule [out] a third term seems to be totally bizarre because actually he’s being rather humble and rather straightforward and telling it like it is.’ Asked repeatedly if he would go for the party leadership, Mr Johnson said: ‘I can’t possibly answer that because it’s a long way off. We probably don’t even know the identity of the next leader … It is some baby, unborn.’ Mr Osborne praised Mr Cameron for giving ‘a direct answer’. Mrs May is yet to comment. But the recent turnaround in his popularity as the economy improves has led many MPs to reconsider. Polls suggest Mr Osborne has become the most popular Conservative Treasury spokesman since Nigel Lawson in 1987. ‘Cameron has propelled George Osborne into the top three, quite deliberately,’ said one senior MP. ‘Whether that helps George or not remains to be seen.’ Another former minister said: ‘It’s not what he has said about timing – it’s the list of names. The Parliamentary party doesn’t really want any of them. Theresa May is a cold loner with a following of about two. George has been a good Chancellor of the Exchequer, but people resent his coterie of apparatchiks and think he is ultimately unelectable. Boris is another Bullingdon Club boy who ignored Parliament when he was last in it and lots of people think would be too risky.’ MPs also questioned how Mr Cameron could promise to serve a ‘full second term’ when a new leader would need at least six months to establish themselves before the 2020 election. Some allies of the Prime Minister, however, suggest he could step down as party leader, allowing a contest to take place some months before, while remaining Prime Minister right up until polling day. While this would be unprecedented in modern British political history, it would mirror the American system, where a president serves a fixed second term. Former Tory minister Michael Portillo described Mr Cameron’s announcement as ‘bizarre’. He told the BBC: ‘When you play chess you have to consider the next two moves, and I don’t think he did. There is no point setting off on this wild goose chase in the middle of an election campaign.’ But Defence Secretary Michael Fallon defended the Prime Minister. ‘He made very clear he is standing for a full second term. What happens in 2020 really, I think, doesn’t bother a lot of people,’ he said. ‘If he had said exactly the opposite – that he wanted to go on and on and he wasn’t prepared to answer the question when he was likely to finish – you’d have accused him, quite rightly, of arrogance and wanting term after term.’ A snap poll by ComRes for the Daily Mail found voters are divided over Mr Cameron’s announcement. Some 70 per cent believe Mr Cameron was ‘just being honest’, while 80 per cent say ten years is long enough for any Prime Minister to achieve their plans. Four in ten said he had made himself a lame duck, but the majority – 59 per cent – disagreed. However, 70 per cent said he should be focusing on voters rather than his own job. Four in ten think the next government would be destabilised by a Tory leadership election.","David Cameron said earlier this week that he would not bid for a third term .

'Everly had stopped breathing at the sitter's house and was being rushed to the hospital.' She had suffered injuries including a build up of blood clots beneath her skull and hemorrhages inside her eyes, and medical staff told authorities the injuries were non-accidental, WSPA reported. After Everly was admitted to hospital, staff called police and the Spartanburg County Sheriff's Office opened an investigation into possible abuse. During the investigation, officials say Harris admitted that she had originally lied about how Everly was injured and said she had actually fallen from a baby swing, WYFF4 reported. Following inconsistent statements, Harris agreed to take a polygraph test, which she failed. Harris was charged with abuse inflicting great bodily injury upon a child on March 23. Once the baby's autopsy has been completed on Tuesday, the charges could be upgraded. Loved: The baby's parents, April and Matt Dickard, pictured, have been married for six years and had long hoped for a family. Relatives called Everly, pictured, the couple's 'most beautiful miracle' Heartbreaking: The little girl was rushed to the ICU with 'non-accidental' head injuries on March 20 . Her lawyer, Robert Ianaurio, said she maintains her innocence. The family's gofundme page, which has raised $28,000, calls Everly 'the most beautiful miracle' for the couple, who have been married for six years and had long hoped to have a family. 'Her parents have adored and loved this precious baby from the second they met her,' it said. 'They have covered her with kisses and done everything right to love and protect her.' The page, which has not been updated since the news of the baby's passing, called it 'the hardest time in their lives' and asked for prayers for the family.","Everly Dickard died in hospital on Monday, more than a week after she stopped breathing while in the care of her babysitter, Katie Harris .

I never had this, but I’d heard the stories and was hoping for that father-son experience when I took my eldest son Jayden to Wembley on Sunday. He’s 10 and a Chelsea fan like his dad. Not like his brother Koby who is seven and declared recently that he’s changing teams to support Manchester United. On my mind was the Paris Metro incident. Not that I was worried about the real Chelsea fans but more so those idiots who put on the shirt claiming to be Chelsea fans without caring what image or message they send out, and are just out to cause trouble. Chelsea supporters pose with Michael Duberry (centre) and his eldest son, Jayden (second right) at Wembley . Chelsea fans cheer on their team in the Capital One Cup Final - and Duberry was one of the supporters at Wembley . Chelsea celebrate winning the Coca-Cola Cup at Wembley in 1998, Duberry's first trophy as a professional . I didn’t know what to expect. I wasn’t 100 per cent confident but we went by public transport on the Jubilee Line to Wembley Park because we wanted to walk down Wembley Way. A cup final wouldn’t be the same without it. It was great to see Jayden’s excited face counting down the stops as we neared the stadium. As soon as we stepped out of the station we saw waves of people in blue and white. What a great feeling it was walking down Wembley Way with my son. As a player you don’t get to experience this. I was loving it as much as him. The different races in Blue shirts walking towards the stadium was clear to see. It was nothing like the image those racist idiots painted of Chelsea fans on the Paris Metro. 'As a player you don’t get to experience the walk down Wembley Way. I loved it as much as my son', said Duberry . 'It was a great feeling it was walking down Wembley Way with my son among different races in Blue shirts' The scenes on Wembley Way vastly contrasted with the behaviour of some fans on the Paris Metro last month . Chelsea have a more cosmopolitan set of fans than when I was playing. You have fans from all nationalities and not only British descent. The club must be happy with the progress and that Paris incident must have felt like a painful kick in the short-and-curlies. After stopping to grab pizza, we went inside and when you see the pitch and the stadium, you can’t help but wish you were out there. I played my one and only Wembley cup final in March 1998 in this same competition, but known then as the Coca-Cola Cup. We beat Middlesbrough 2-0 and it was my first trophy as a professional. The Chelsea supporters at Wembley were a mixed set of fans from different races, families and groups . 'When John Terry scored the first Chelsea goal I enjoyed a brilliant, that father-son moment of celebrating' As we took our seats, I gave him a history lesson about the day I played in this final 17 years ago. Around us again were a mixed set of Chelsea fans from different races, families, groups of lads and father and sons. After a while a few asked for pictures with me and also offered some kind words to me about my time at the club, dads explaining to their kids I used to play for Chelsea and making me feel old. Flag waving and singing songs with Jayden and the other Chelsea fans was great. I just had to make sure he missed out certain words to a few songs and it was fine. When John Terry scored the first Chelsea goal it was brilliant, that father-son moment of celebrating was priceless, then to see the other fans celebrating with him was great. And just when I thought the smile on his face couldn’t get any bigger his favourite player, Diego Costa scored the second. 'Diego Costa (right), my son's favourite player, scored the second goal to seal victory for Chelsea' Costa's deflected effort beat Hugo Lloris to make it 2-0 to Chelsea in the Capital One Cup Final . When the final whistle went, we were high-fiving and hugging strangers and watching JT lift the trophy which brought back memories for myself of Dennis Wise letting Gianluca Vialli lift the trophy in 1998. We went home on the Tube amongst lots of Spurs fans, disappointed but singing very loudly. Jayden kept laughing every time he heard a rude word. It was the only part of the day when I felt uncomfortable. It was a shame to hear more stories about alleged racism on a train later in the night. 'Watching Terry lift the trophy with his team-mates brought back memories of my Coca-Cola Cup win' Costa and Terry pose with the Capital One Cup trophy on the Wembley pitch after the 2-0 victory . The sooner a strong radical punishment for such behaviour is put in place the better it is for all. Thankfully we saw nothing like it. I had enjoyed the day as a black father and a Chelsea fan watching his team win at Wembley. The only colour that mattered was the same one wrapped around the cup…….Blue. 'The only colour that mattered was the one of the ribbons on the trophy, and they were Chelsea blue'","I took my son to Wembley  to support Chelsea in the Capital One Cup Final .
Chelsea's support on the day was multicultural and welcoming .
My only concern were the rude words that my 10-year-old son could hear .
But news of more alleged racism by fans on a train was disappointing .
I enjoyed the day as a black father and a Chelsea fan watching his team win ."
5c58b5548d8316b790fc6204d035e79f67f3165a,"In what was Britain’s first industrial war, huge amounts of munitions were needed - but the men who dominated manufacturing jobs had left to fight. So it was down to more than 600,000 women to take on roles in mills, laboratories and factories to help the First World War effort on the Home Front. And these photographs show women munitions workers making shells and fuses for the first time in a Greater Manchester factory in 1915. Teamwork: Women munitions workers began making shells and fuses for the first time in this factory in Oldham, Greater Manchester, in 1915 . Posed up: One electrical engineering firm that diversified and began to employ women in 1915 was owned by Sebastian Ziani de Ferranti . Many firms in the North West and elsewhere converted to start making munitions in the war, with women now working alongside men in these jobs. And one electrical engineering firm that diversified and began to employ women in 1915 was owned by Sebastian Ziani de Ferranti in Oldham. The company had previously made meters and transformers, but switched production to fuses and 18-pounder shells in 1915. In the same year, Mr de Ferranti hired the first female supervisor - family friend Olivia Forbes, who ended up working for the firm for 40 years. It was her job to recruit new female workers at the factory, where there were more than 1,000 women working by the end of the war in 1918. Katie Belshaw, curator of an exhibition on Manchester’s war effort, said: ‘It was something that had to be done because the men were going off to fight. Hard work: Many companies  converted to start making munitions during the war, with women now working alongside men in these jobs . Getting involved: Britain was facing a huge shortage of munitions on the front lines in 1915, leading to what became known as the Shells Crisis . ‘But instead of the women coming in and doing the same job that a male skilled worker would do, they broke down the job into smaller pieces.' She told MailOnline: ‘They would have worked on turning the shells and finishing them - making them smoother once they had been manufactured. ‘They even were driving trucks around the factory, operating lifts - they really were doing what the men were doing.’ Britain was facing a huge shortage of munitions on the front lines of the war in 1915, leading to what became known as the Shells Crisis. The Government appointed David Lloyd George as munitions minister, which prompted the construction of new shell factories across Britain. The exhibition at Manchester's Museum of Science and Industry features diaries, company archives, sketches and letters written by Mr de Ferranti. Diversifying: The company had previously made meters and transformers, but switched production to fuzes and 18-pounder shells in 1915 . Family: The exhibition at Museum of Science and Industry features diaries, sketches and letters written by Mr de Ferranti (second left, back) These include letters the engineer wrote to his sons Basil and Vincent fighting at the front and rare sketches of his munitions. Also featuring are images of his daughter Vera who worked on the production line at her father’s factory during the war. And there will also be a section on the Munitions Inventions Department, which received ideas submitted by the public on how to win the war. Examples of rejected inventions range from training seagulls to defecate on enemy periscopes to mounting machine guns on artificially frozen clouds. Rachel Knight, head of exhibitions at the museum, said visitors will be given an ‘insightful, original and personal take’ on the war. The Innovation Race: Manchester’s Makers Join the First World War is open at the Museum of Science and Industry from Saturday until April 2016. Suffragist and suffragette leaders volunteered their members to take the place of men in industrial work after they went off to fight in the war. While the offer was at first met with scepticism by the Government, eventually the numbers of men leaving meant they had to take on these women. More than 600,000 women became employed in munitions factories and performed other roles such as working as bus conductors or farm hands. Then, in 1918, the right to vote was given to 'respectable' women aged over 30 who were householders, or married to householders. Historians have debated how much this was down to the war effort, with some saying the vote was a token of thanks for women’s efforts in the UK. Others believe war sped up a process which began before the conflict started, with it highlighting women’s huge economic value to Britain. It is also said the women’s political cause gained credibility during the war because they served such a huge role - especially in the medical services. In 1928 women were given equal voting rights with men, with 15million females eligible to vote in the general election the following year.","600,000 women took on roles in mills, laboratories and factories to help First World War effort on Home Front .

c38497a50ddc4ea9dafdd74c53a4c7be4556bf06,"Roy Hodgson had in his hand a piece of paper. Well, more of a crumpled scrap, to be honest, and it was more a reminder of his ambition and his faith in the future than a declaration of war. When Hodgson unfolded his training notes, they included names scribbled in biro for a session at St George's Park and the two circled were Wayne Rooney and Harry Kane. Captain Rooney, with 101 caps and 46 goals, had started the day with a formal presentation of the England player of the year award for 2014, as voted for by supporters. Is this going to be England's new strike partnership for the Euro 2016 qualifier against Lithuania on Friday? Harry Kane trains with the England senior squad for the first team at St George's Park on Tuesday morning . Roy Hodgson holds a piece of paper which seems to pair Wayne Rooney and Kane together in attack . Hodgson talks with assistant manager Ray Lewington (left) and coach Gary Neville during the session . Kane jogs alongside Rooney (3rd right) and uncapped Tottenham team-mate Ryan Mason (2nd right) Kane goes through a drill with the ball as training gets underway at England's Burton-upon-Trent base . Kane challenges Everton midfielder Ross Barkley for the ball during Tuesday's session . Games played: 26 . Minutes played: 1,876 . Goals: 19 . Right foot: 10 . Left foot: 5 . Headed: 4 . Inside area: 17 . Outside area: 2 . Kane was the new-boy, uncapped, in his first squad, but with eyes and lenses focused on him in search of clues about whether his Tottenham goal rate could be transplanted to the international stage. The 21-year-old Spurs striker took his tally for the season to 29 with a hat-trick against Leicester on Saturday and inched a little closer to his England debut when Daniel Sturridge pulled out with an injury. Hodgson proved with Alex Oxlade-Chamberlain and Raheem Sterling that he can be bold when it comes to selecting young players and his key decisions will revolve around whether to start with Kane against Lithuania in a sell-out Euro 2016 qualifier at Wembley, on Friday. Kyle Walker (left), Kane and Phil Jones in action during England's first training session of the week . England manager Hodgson could hand Kane his England debut against Lithuania on Friday . Kane's chances of making his England debut improved after Daniel Sturridge withdrew from the squad . Kane has scored 29 goals in all competitions for club side Tottenham Hotspur this term . 'His confidence must be sky-high,' said England's vice-captain Gary Cahill. 'To meet up with England for the first time off the back of a hat-trick, he is in a good place and deserves his place in this squad. 'For me he's ready to play, I'm sure he'd relish the opportunity, but so are the other guys. So that's down to the manager. 'It's always daunting when you're in the squad for the first time, even if you' re in fantastic form and I'm sure Harry's no different. He's still a young boy. But he needs to carry on doing what he does at club level. Everyone is aware of him. Everyone knows him. This should be no different. I'm sure he'll do terrifically well if called upon.' At club level, Cahill has played against him three times this season, winning twice with Chelsea, including the Capital One Cup final, and losing 5-3 at White Hart Lane on New Year's Day, when Kane scored twice. Kane and his England team-mates listen to instructions during a break in training . Rooney (centre) was presented with England Player of the Year award as voted for by fans . Gary Cahill applies pressure to the England new-boy during training on Tuesday morning . 'It's hard to talk a young player up too much because we do that a lot in this country, but for me he has everything,' said Cahill. 'He can hold the ball up, he runs in behind, he has two good feet, he can head, he can finish, he has a bit of pace and physically he is strong enough. 'For me, the attributes a striker needs are all there. It's about how he progresses. He comes across as a top professional.' The England players tried to make the transition smooth for Kane when he arrived at St George's Park on Monday. 'You introduce yourself and we train together,' said Cahill. Sturridge's thigh injury leaves Hodgson with three recognised strikers. Rooney will start as he closes in on Sir Bobby Charlton's England goal record after two goals in Scotland, in November, and Danny Welbeck performed well, scoring twice in a 3-1 win against Slovenia, three days before. If Hodgson sticks with a diamond formation Kane will be competing for a starting berth with Danny Welbeck . Michael Carrick is hoping the manager plays with a diamond because it will better suit the midfielder . If Hodgson sticks with the diamond midfield formation, which has served him well since he introduced it for the first qualifier in Switzerland, he will have to choose between Kane and Welbeck to partner the captain up front. This shape suits Sterling, in behind the strikers, and Michael Carrick, in front of the centre-halves, with Jordan Henderson and Fabian Delph providing the mileage on either side. Delph has been ill and is yet to train with England this week but he reported to the camp yesterday. Another option Hodgson will consider, especially if Delph is below full power, is a 4-2-3-1 system with Henderson deep in tandem with Carrick and Kane up front, ahead of Welbeck, Rooney and Sterling. 'We've played a diamond enough times at Manchester United,' said Carrick. 'That's not to say it's the only position I can play, but it's a formation that would probably suit me. Hopefully it will.'","England play Lithuania in a Euro 2016 qualifier at Wembley on Friday night .

c0bb36dd28f8d907967cade0cafb2c0bfbd4f192,"A new survey of voters has revealed the TV characters they most associate with party leaders with David Cameron described as Dick Dastardly, while Ed Miliband is compared to Mr Bean. The poll, commissioned by former Tory treasurer Lord Ashcroft also saw Liberal Democrat leader Nick Clegg likened to Fred from Scooby Doo. While Ukip's Nigel Farage was associated with tough-guy actor Ray Winstone. A new poll has shown that voters most associate David Cameron with the Wacky Races cartoon character Dick Dastardly, right . Voters likened Labour leader Ed Miliband, left, to comic character Mr Bean, right, played by Rowan Atkinson . The survey comes as the poll that a study of marginal constituencies suggests Labour and the Conservatives are heading for electoral 'deadlock' in May, with neither party able to govern. It also revealed that a dramatic surge by the SNP looks set to claim Gordon Brown’s seat and rob Labour of a Commons majority. It suggests the Scottish nationalists are on course for a landslide in May, winning as many as 56 of Scotland’s 59 seats – up from just six at present. The SNP surge would claim seats held by a string of household names, including Gordon Brown, Alistair Darling and former Liberal Democrat leader Charles Kennedy. The Tories are also in danger of losing their one Scottish seat. The poll suggests that Labour and the Conservatives will be tied on 272 seats each – well short of the 326 needed to command a Commons majority. Fred from Scooby Doo, right, was the TV character the voters polled most associated with Lib Dem leader Nick Clegg . The poll also revealed that Ukip leader Nigel Farage, left, is associated with tough guy actor Ray Winstone, right . Lord Ashcroft said the astonishing surge by the SNP in the wake of last year’s independence referendum had thrown a ‘giant spanner in Labour’s works’. The poll suggests a weak Ed Miliband government propped up by the Scottish nationalists could be likely. The two parties would have a combined total of 328 seats – producing a Commons majority of just three. Former SNP leader Alex Salmond, who is planning a return to Westminster, could become deputy prime minister in any deal. His party has ruled out supporting the Conservatives. Gordon Brown’s seat, where the former prime minister is stepping down, currently has one of the biggest Labour majorities in the country . And it has warned that it will demand a ruinously high price from Labour, including billions more in spending and borrowing, home rule for Scotland and the scrapping of Britain’s Trident nuclear deterrent. Gordon Brown’s Kirkcaldy and Cowdenbeath seat, where the former prime minister is stepping down, currently has one of the biggest Labour majorities in the country. But the new poll forecasts an incredible 28.5 per cent swing to the SNP, giving the nationalists a comfortable six-point lead. In Edinburgh South West, where former chancellor Alistair Darling is also stepping down, the poll predicts an SNP win with a 22 per cent swing. The Scottish nationalists are also set to win Ross, Skye and Lochaber, which Mr Kennedy has held since 1983. New Scottish Labour leader Jim Murphy is forecast to cling on in East Renfrewshire – but he could be one of only two Labour MPs remaining. Polling was also conducted in a number of marginal seats in England and Wales. The Tories are set to hold on in Vale of Glamorgan as well as Colne Valley, West Yorkshire, where they are narrowly ahead. But Labour is edging towards victory in two other Tory-held marginals – Norwich North and High Peak, in Derbyshire.","New poll has shown which TV characters voters associate with leaders .

In the early hours of Sunday morning a man from Sunshine in Victoria ran out of fuel about one kilometre east of Ararat on the Western Highway. He went on foot to a local petrol station to get a jerry can but could not see what he was doing when he returned to the car. Cars have gone up in flames for a variety of reasons, but setting one on fire because the person was using a cigarette lighter to see while filling it with a jerry can has to be the worst one yet . ABC reports that Acting Inspector Brendan Broadbent said the man lost all common sense when trying to find a solution to the problem. ‘Because there was no light he's actually, in the process of pouring fuel into his vehicle, he's used his lighter to light up the area so he could see,’ he said. Police said the man abandoned common sense in the search for a solution to filling his car with the jerry can in the dark . ‘Subsequently the fumes have ignited and the vehicle's caught on fire.’ The rear of the car was burnt but Acting Inspector Broadbent said the man was lucky to escape without injury. ‘That could have been far worse.’","A man from Sunshine in Victoria ran out of fuel on the Western Highway .

One local station has identified the man suspected of being behind the mass shooting as 41-year-old Ryan Giroux, but authorities have not confirmed that information. According to online records, Giroux spent more than six years behind bars for aggravated assault. Mesa police closed off an area around the East Valley Institute of Technology on Wednesday morning. Meanwhile, Mesa Community College issued an emergency alert, saying its campus was on lockdown and anyone already there should proceed to the safest location. The Mesa Police Department said on its Twitter page there was an active shooting in the city, which is less than 15 miles east of Phoenix. The shooting scene was near a light rail line that travels through the metro Phoenix area. Just before 1pm local time, Mesa police announced that the alleged shooter was caught in the area of 8th Avenue and Dobson Road. Television cameras captured the moment the alleged perpetrator was led by a throng of armed officers in handcuffs. The man was wearing a white hazmat suit, likely because police had removed his clothing to collect DNA evidence. Detective Flores told reporters just before 2pm PT that the suspect was taken into custody after a SWAT team spotted him standing on the balcony of a vacant condo in the 1700 block of West Emelita Avenue.

A man was pronounced dead at the scene and two women suffered injuries, Flores told reporters, according to AZ Central. Tanya Ehrig, a 27-year-old mother from Mesa, said the slain victim was her sister's boyfriend. She was photographed sobbing outside the motel swarming with police. The gunman then moved to nearby Bistro 13, an off-campus restaurant run by EVIT, where he shot a student who was able to go across the street to get help. The victim was taken to a hospital with life-threatening injuries, but he is expected to survive. Detective Flores said the gunman then carjacked an EVIT teacher in the parking lot and drove the stolen car, a grey Honda Accord, to the Emelita Avenue and South Longmore area. Shortly after, police got a call about an attempted home invasion in the 900 block of South Dobson Road. Officers who responded to the apartment building found a man suffering from a gunshot wound. He is expected to recover. Flores said the suspect carried on the crime spree critically wounding another man, described as a maintenance worker, in the 800 block of West Emelita Avenue.

Mikhail Ivan Gallatinov, 40, who was jailed in 1997 for what a judge labelled a ‘callous, chilling killing’, married fellow prisoner Marc Goodwin, 31, yesterday, it has been reported. Goodwin was the leader of a gang that roamed the streets of Blackpool looking for homosexuals to attack. He was jailed for life with a minimum of 18 years in 2007 after being found guilty of murdering Malcolm Benfold, 57, who was beaten to death. His trial heard that he and two friends had agreed to go ‘gay bashing’. Wed: Mikhail Ivan Gallatinov (right), 40, who was jailed in 1997 for what a judge labelled a ‘callous, chilling killing’, married fellow prisoner Marc Goodwin (left), 31, yesterday . According to reports, the 15-minute ceremony, during which the prisoners wore suits, was attended by four family members. Mr Benfold's sister, Wendy Bridge, from Newton-le-Willows, Merseyside has previously spoken out against the wedding. 'I don’t object to a prisoner having a wedding, but when its two murderers getting married to each other, that’s wrong,' she told the Liverpool Echo. 'Marriage should be something to aim for when they get out, to build a home and a new life with someone,' she added. It came at no cost to the public purse, a Prison Service spokesman said. 'We are very clear that if prisoners do get married, the taxpayer does not foot the bill for the ceremony and they are certainly not allowed to share a cell,' he added. It is believed that the couple had considered a civil partnership until a change in the law in March last year made homosexual marriage legal in Britain. Goodwin and Gallatinov – who strangled 28-year-old gay man Adrian Kaminsky – met while behind bars, according to the Daily Mirror. Gallatinov, of Manchester, who previously served a prison sentence for sexually abusing children, was jailed for a minimum of 20 years for the murder of Mr Kaminsky – meaning he could be eligible for parole in two years. The convicted murderers wed at HMP Full Sutton, Yorkshire (pictured) and was the first gay wedding in a British prison . There was a 15-minute chapel ceremony at HMP Full Sutton, Yorkshire, which was attended by four of their relatives, according to The Sun . He spoke to his victim on a gay chat line before luring him to his home. At the time of his sentencing, Judge Rhys Davies QC said the murder was ‘a cold-blooded, well planned, callous, chilling and apparently motiveless killing’. The case was particularly shocking because Gallatinov was under police surveillance at the time and had actually told an undercover detective that he intended to commit murder. Officers were positioned outside his house at the time of the killing and he photographed his victim with a camera that he had been lent by detectives. Mr Kaminsky’s body was later found nearly naked in the boot of Gallatinov’s car after he was stopped on a motorway. Goodwin, originally of Airdrie, near Glasgow, is expected to serve at least another ten years behind bars.","Mikhail Ivan Gallatinov, 40, married fellow prisoner Marc Goodwin, 31 .

European Jews are living in fear 'like the 1930s', the World Jewish Congress leader has warned as he called on the U.S. to speak out against the rise of anti-Semitism across the continent. Ronald Lauder - the billionaire son of Estee Lauder -  told a congressional committee in Washington that America must take the lead against the surge in anti-Semitic incidents in Europe in order to 'defeat the new flame of Islamic terror'. He pointed to the strong line taken by European leaders in the wake of attacks like those seen in Paris, Toulouse and Copenhagen earlier this year, and urged the U.S. to follow in their footsteps. 'Once again, like the 1930s, European Jews live in fear,' said Lauder. 'The United States can and must speak loudly and clearly to condemn this evil for what it is - the radical Islamic hatred of Jews.' Mr Lauder, who has led the World Jewish Congress since 2007, pointed to the fact Jews make up just one per cent of France's population, yet were victim to half the country's racist attacks. He also noted that anti-Semitic attacks have not only doubled in France in the past year, but also in the UK and Austria. He stressed: 'To defeat this new flame of radical Islamic terror and survive... the United States must lead.' Mr Lauder also revealed a recent meeting with Jewish leaders in Rome had revealed they believed the Italian capital would have no Jewish community within 25 years. According to Forbes, Mr Lauder claimed they say their children and grandchildren will look for more welcoming countries in which to make their homes in in the future. 'There is a hatred growing throughout Europe that is causing Jews to wonder if they should leave. They are asking if there is a future for Jews on that continent,' he told the committee. Terror: The recent attacks in Paris (pictured), Toulouse and Copenhagen have left many in fear . Fear: Lauder says Jews are living in fear 'like the 1930s' after incidents like the Copenhagen attack (pictured) Mr Lauder was joined by two other members of the WJC, which represents Jewish communities in 100 countries, who echoed his fears. Dan Asmussen, a Danish Jewish leader, noted Danish society 'itself is not and has never been anti-Semitic and many of the threats facing Danish Jewry - like in the rest of Europe - come from marginalized and radicalized Muslims, and these form a small minority of all Muslims in Denmark.' Roger Cukierman, a French Jewish leader, added: 'This is a war against Western modern civilization. And the Jews are seen by these Jihadists as a privileged target. 'We Jews are the sentinels at the forefront of this war. But we are not the only victims. 'Military forces, policemen and women, journalists were also targeted and killed.'","Ronald Lauder told congressional committee U.S. needs to take the lead .

7faf1bfca3fc25ff8914ce9ea704db9d60395941,"Crippling cuts to defence spending have left Britain unable to defend itself or stand up to Russia, according to the former head of the Army. General Sir Peter Wall said the 'consequences' of the squeeze on funding is now 'playing out' in the UK's approach to dealing with Vladimir Putin. He joins a growing chorus of criticism of the refusal by any of the main parties to protect defence spending from cuts after the election, despite a pledge to increase foreign aid budgets being enshrined in law. General Sir Peter Wall said the 'consequences' of the squeeze on funding is now 'playing out' in the UK's approach to dealing with Vladimir Putin . A defence think tank has warned that up to 30,000 members of the forces face redundancy over the next parliament. David Cameron has repeatedly refused to pledge that funding for the military will be kept above the Nato target of at least 2 per cent of GDP. The 2013-14 defence budget was £34.3billion, down from £35.9billion in 2010-11, when the coalition took over. Sir Peter, who retired as head of the army last summer, warned the West has been 'caught napping' amid increasing threats from the Russian Federation and Islamic State. He criticised the 2010 Strategic Defence and Security Review (SDSR) and said funding reductions were based on the assumption that there would be a 'reasonably benign security environment for this decade' following the drawdown of combat troops from Afghanistan. 'It was acknowledged that we would have less capability in an unexpected crisis than we would wish, and our political choices would be constrained,' he told the Daily Telegraph. 'We can now see those consequences playing out in our reticence to counter Russian expansionism, and her interference in our airspace and offshore waters.' Sir Peter called on the Government to meet the Nato target of spending 2 per cent of national income on defence. He wrote: 'In an era of moral and physical disarmament the West has been caught napping.' It comes after a report by the Royal United Services Institute (Rusi) said it was inevitable that Britain's defence spending would drop below the Nato target in the face of continuing austerity cuts. Up to 30,000 service personnel could go - with the Army likely to bear the heaviest cuts - leaving the armed forces with a combined strength of just 115,000 by the end of the decade, it predicted. Prime Minister David Cameron is under growing pressure from Tory MPs and peers to make a manifesto commitment to the target to spend 2 per cent of GDP on defence . Prime Minister David Cameron is under growing pressure from Tory MPs and peers to make a manifesto commitment to the target. The leadership is braced for significant criticism over its position when a backbench business motion comes before the Commons on Thursday. Nick Clegg has claimed Mr Cameron will fail to spend 2 per cent of GDP on defence because he is ideologically wedded to shrinking the state. Labour has also refused to commit to the figure, with the party's Treasury spokesman, Chris Leslie, telling the BBC: 'I know it will be difficult to keep that level of 2 per cent of GDP, but I can tell you it is absolutely impossible under the Conservative trajectory.'","Sir Peter Wall says consequences of budget cuts are now 'playing out'

90830505e9dd2498bc125ea2ec8925304e32d46d,"It was a foregone conclusion that  HTC would use this year's Mobile World Congress to launch its latest handset, but the Taiwanese firm had something else up its sleeve. At the event in Barcelona the phone maker unveiled early details about a full-body virtual reality system it has developed in partnership with gaming giant Valve. The system, dubbed RE Vive, moves beyond just a headset and uses Kinect-style lasers to track even the smallest of body movements, letting players become fully immersed in their games. At Mobile World Congress HTC unveiled early details of a full-body virtual reality system developed in partnership with gaming giant Valve. The system moves beyond a headset (pictured) and uses Kinect-style lasers to track the smallest of body movements, letting players become fully immersed in game . Kinect is a system designed by Microsoft for use with its Xbox games consoles. The technology can read up to six skeletons at once and its 'small object detection' is said to be two-and-a-half times better. This means it can identify small movements of the hand on a controller, for example. HTC’s Vive has ‘full room scale’ and two wireless controllers with hand tracking. A developer version will launch in the spring and the consumer model will go on sale later in the year. The system is powered by the Oculus Rift technology and HTC will announce more information nearer the time of the developer launch. HTC also used the event to unveil its 5-inch HTC One M9 phone with 20MP camera and a fitness band, in partnership with Under Armour. In particular, the M8's rear-facing 4 Ultrapixel camera has been added to the front of the M9, and the M9's rear camera has been upgraded to 20MP. Kinect is a system designed by Microsoft for use with its Xbox games consoles.The technology can read up to six skeletons at once and its 'small object detection' is said to be two-and-a-half times better.This means it can identify small movements of the hand on a controller, for example (pictured) Ultrapixels are, for all intents and purposes, another name for megapixels. However, each individual pixel is marginally larger meaning they capture more light. In addition to the upgraded lenses, HTC has developed software called Dynamic Exposure designed around the human eye. When a photo is taken on the One M9, this algorithm makes it appear as close to how the human eye would view it as possible, with the same light adjustment and focus. It also adds similar depth qualities, boosted by the dual camera the firm originally added on the M8. 'I have previously struggled to buy into virtual reality when it consisted of sitting on a chair and simply looking around, but HTC’s Vive system has convinced me otherwise. During the demonstration I was taken into a room that was empty except for a computer setup, the HTC Vive headset, two controllers and sensors on two of the walls. These sensors use lasers to plot the room’s shape, size and obstacles. For the demonstration version, the headset was attached to the computer using wires. But the HTC spokesman told MailOnline this was because of the interference from the various networks covering the trade show and the final version will be wireless. During a demonstration MailOnline's Victoria Woollaston was taken into a room that was empty except for a computer setup, the HTC Vive headset (pictured), two controllers and sensors on two of the walls. These sensors use lasers to plot the room’s shape, size and obstacles . Once I put the headset on, a grid appeared around me similar to how the holodeck appears in Star Trek. The demonstrator handed me the wireless controllers, which in itself was a strange experience to see controllers ‘floating’ towards you but not see the hands holding them. I was then trained to use the controllers by blowing up a balloon with the left hand and punching it through the air with the right. The first ‘experience’ dropped me underwater onto a sunken ship. Small fish swam around me, which I could ‘touch’ and move. I could look over the edge of the ship and explore the deck. If at any point I approached a real-world obstacle, a feint grid would appear to warn me. During this experience a virtual stingray swam near my face and a huge whale made me jump as it appeared on my left shoulder and cast a shadow over me. Another experience involved painting in the air. Colours and brushes were selected with the left controller and painted with the right. These paintings hung in the air and I was able to walk through them. I also made snow fall around me. A third involved exploring a kitchen, making a meal and serving it. At one point I dropped an egg near my foot and it broke and made a mess. I could use the controllers and triggers to pick up objects, move them around and drop them. These skills were then put to the test during another experience in which I had to repair a robot. While the final experience had me placed in the middle of a virtual battle. I could explore the battleground and kneel down so my face was in line with the ground. I couldn't count the number of times I jumped, laughed, expressed surprise and was wowed by this technology. And this is an early version, with a limited number of trials. By these standards, this technology has the potential to live up to HTC’s claims of being revolutionary. That said, there is one substantial benefit to having a stationary virtual reality experience compared to one you can explore and that’s convenience. I can’t imagine many people have rooms they can dedicate entirely to this technology, or want to spend money on a host of kit, rather than just a headset. As it stands though this technology literally took my breath away at times and was the stand out tech of this year’s Mobile World Congress.' Victoria Woollaston . The 'full-body virtual reality system' was a surprise announcement at an event where HTC also unveiled it M9 handset and a fitness band. The M9 has added incremental changes compared to previous M8 (pictured) and these include taking the 4 Ultrapixel camera from rear of M8 and adding it to the front of the M9 . Handset: HTC has also unveiled its 5-inch HTC One M9 phone with 20MP camera and a fitness band . Beside this, however, the changes between the HTC One M8 and M9 are incremental with the majority of tweaks being made to the operating system. These include highly customisable themes and dynamic home screens. Using the phone's location, and by learning about a user's habits, the M9 will change which icons appear on the home screen throughout the day. For example, if it knows the user is at home it will prioritise gaming and social network apps, but when it senses the user is near a tube or train station it will push the National Rail app - or similar - to the front. It only suggests apps that the user has already installed, and the suggestions can be customised or switched off completely. Elsewhere, the M9 is powered by the latest Qualcomm Snapdragon technology and features 3GB of RAM. It has 32GB of storage with the option to extend this using an SD card, plus all customers get 100GB Google Drive for two years. MailOnline's Victoria Woollaston reveals her first impressions of HTC's new device. 'There is little to get excited about with the One M9. 'Its predecessors- the original One known as M7 and the One M8 - are well-made, well-built and were global successes. 'And the M9 is more of the same. 'This means it has the same great design and feels comfortable to hold - so is far from a criticism - but it hardly warrants spending money to upgrade, especially from the M8. 'The standout feature of the M9 is its cameras. 'HTC leads the way with smartphone cameras and has tapped into the growing trend of 'smartphone photography'. 'By adding the 4Ultrapixel camera from the M8 to the front of the M9, it also understands its customers love of selfies. 'Seeing the Dynamic Exposure in action does highlight how shots on iPhone and Android devices can sometimes fall short, but again, this isn't a reason to upgrade on its own. 'Beyond that the innovations are minimal. 'HTC prides itself on including features that add value rather than gimmicks, but without these there seems little incentive to switch - especially if you're a Samsung or Apple owner. 'Many of its software features, such as BlinkFeed and the new dynamic homescreen, will appeal to hardcore HTC fans, but may seem like bloatware to others. 'That's not to say the phone is poor, and if an M7 owner is looking to upgrade then the M9 seems like an obvious choice. 'But by tapping into its existing market rather than looking to expand, the handset may struggle to emulate its predecessors successes.' The phone will be available from 31 March in three colours - 'gold on silver', 'gum metal grey on grey' and 'gold on gold.' Prices are yet to be announced. HTC also used the event to launch its first fitness band in partnership with Under Armour. The partnership was announced in January and Under Armour’s team of designers, sports scientists and athletes have worked with HTC’s Connected Products to create the wearable. It will work with UA Record - an app that lets people record and analyse their activity levels from various other apps such as MyFitnessPal and Endomodo. The band  pairs with Android 4.3+ and iOS 7+ to also show phone notifications. It will additionally respond to gestures to make it easier to control when exercising, for example. HTC said the band launch in the US later this year and the company is 'evaluating' it in Europe. Again, no price details were given. The M9's rear camera has been upgraded to 20MP. In addition to the new lenses, HTC has developed software called Dynamic Exposure designed to mimic the human eye. When a photo is taken this algorithm adjusts exposure, focus and depth accordingly. This is boosted by the dual-lens setup added on the M8 (shown) Beside the camera updates, the differences between the HTC One M8 and M9 are incremental, with the majority of tweaks being made to the operating system.

5f647f2deb5e17adb47dd20d6431dd6114a920fc,"They were just ten and seven when their beautiful TV presenter mother, Caron Keating, lost a long battle with breast cancer at just 41. A decade later, they have transformed from angelic-looking boys into strapping, handsome young men. Charlie is currently enjoying a year out from his advertising degree to complete internships and Gabriel, his gentle younger brother, is in his final year studying his A-levels. Scroll down for video . All grown up: Gloria Hunniford pictured with her grandsons Gabriel (far left) and Charlie (far right). The boys were just ten and seven when they lost their mum, Caron Keating, to breast cancer . As they were: Doting Gloria, pictured with her grandsons as young children, says she feels disappointment that her daughter isn't here to watch her sons' achievements . The days when she could cradle them in her arms have long passed but their achievements leave their grandmother, Gloria Hunniford, bursting with pride. However she admits her happiness hides traces of disappointment that their mother has missed sharing their milestones. The Loose Women panelist and TV presenter, 74, said: ‘The only time I do get frustrated is when I think about all the brilliant moments Caron’s missing as the boys grow up. 'When Charlie first went to university, I felt really quite disturbed by that. Caron had an understanding of English literature that I don’t have. She would have loved to sit down with Charlie and now with Gabriel to discuss whatever it was that they were studying. ‘From the research I’ve done, it seems that a child misses a parent most when he graduates, when he gets engaged, when he marries and particularly when he has his first child. You want to show your child to your parents. And Charlie and Gabriel will never be able to do that with their mother.’ What bolsters Miss Hunniford, who is married to hairdresser Stephen Way, is the warm and loving relationship she has with her grandsons. They tease her mercilessly, which she plainly adores, calling her a variety of names from Glo, to G-Dog, G-Lo or Big G. She said: ‘What helps to sustain me now is that they’ve turned out to be such fine young men. And I think it’s lovely that they’re still very huggy with me, very demonstrative which isn’t always the case with boys of their age and they rib me all the time. ‘They’re part of my healing. I see Caron’s spirit living on in them and that’s a comfort to me. Charlie has her wicked sense of humour and Gabriel looks so like her. They’ve been in my life from the moment they entered the world, quite literally. Caron asked me to be there as each of them was born. So the bond between us has always been exceptionally tight and was made even more so because of her loss.’ Miss Keating was a popular Blue Peter presenter and was diagnosed with breast cancer in 1997. She was initially told she would be lucky to survive more than 18 months but went on to live for seven years before she died in her mother’s arms in 2004. Unbreakable bond: Gloria keeps the memory of Caron, who passed away in 2004, alive with regular fundraising events for the Caron Keating Foundation . Soon after, Miss Hunniford, backed by the rest of the family, set up the Caron Keating Foundation which has now raised millions, given away in small grants to hundreds of deserving causes for all types of cancer. At the end of November (2014), a glitzy dinner at the Dorchester was organised to celebrate Caron’s life and to talk about the foundation. A succession of famous faces, both in person and on screen, paid their tributes. Ant and Dec, Cliff Richard, Janet Ellis, Rod Stewart, Michael Ball, Neil Diamond, Rob Brydon – all shared recollections of the popular TV presenter. The Blue Peter presenter lost her battle with breast cancer when her sons, Charlie and Gabriel, were just 10 and seven . Charlie joked: ‘And I learnt a few things about Mum - I didn’t know that Phillip Schofield could have been my dad. Apparently, he and Mum went out together for about a year which was something no one had ever told me.’ There were insights for Gabriel, too, about his quirky dress sense: ‘I didn’t realise me and my mum shared the same shopping habits. She also tended to buy clothes that a normal person might not. 'For example, I got it into my head recently to buy a completely white puffa jacket which is totally impractical as I discovered today when a girl gave me a big hug and got foundation all down it. Glo tells me Mum was into grunge before it had been invented. She had a really wacky dress sense. And she was a hoarder like me.’ Gloria on Caron's wedding day to the boys' father Russ Lindsay. He's since gone on to remarry, to television presenter Sally Meen, and have two daughters . Their father Russ Lindsay went on to marry breakfast presenter Sally Meen, 49, in 2006 and the boys have two half-sisters they adore: Tilly, six and Flora. Charlie and Gabriel are committed to running the foundation in the future but for now Miss Hunniford is more than happy to carry on, for keeping Caron’s memory alive is a source of comfort: ‘I have a little saying,’ she said: ‘People never die if they live on the lips of the living.’ For more information, www.caronkeating.org .","Caron Keating lost a seven-year battle with breast cancer in 2004, aged 41 .

Now Sydney-based Joe Bonington is training ordinary Aussies to do exactly the same and cross these expeditions off their adventure bucket list. The 47-year-old adventure trainer shares how his father, British mountaineering legend Sir Chris Bonington, helped turn his troubled life around and experience the unforgettable feeling of achieving what he once thought was impossible.

The Sydney-based man is training ordinary Aussies conquer the world's toughest mountains and walking trails . Mr Bonington, who runs Joe's Basecamp in Brookvale on Sydney's Northern Beaches, says he saw the change in himself the moment he reached the peak of Mount Kilimanjaro, Tanzania. 'I had quite a troubled childhood - my father was quite famous at the time,' Mr Bonington told Daily Mail Australia. 'I went off the rails a bit and got into a bit of trouble because I was sick of people asking me if I was going to follow in my father's footsteps. 'I guess when I was young, I kind of wanted to make my own mark and also couldn't really understand why my dad spent days away on these trips. 'I was always scared that he was going to get killed - like all his friends did. It was quite hard for a young kid to digest.' At the age of 24,  he embarked on his very first expedition with the help of his father. 'That year I decided to go on my first expedition and it absolutely changed my life,' Mr Bonington said.

I remember seeing my dad crying his eyes out as I went off on my own. 'When I reached the top, I just burst into tears. I just stood there crying because I finally understood why my dad did what he does. 'I learnt that yes there are risks but what you get from these experiences just outweighs everything else. 'That first experience taught me that I need to get out of my comfort zone and I've been doing that ever since. I'm now teaching others to do the same.' Having completed The Kokoda Trail in 2004, climbed to Everest base camp in 2008 and 2010 - with plans to go again next year with his clients - Mr Bonington says his most memorable adventure was in 2000.

'That's when I went up an unclimbed peak with my dad in a remote part of Nepal,' he said. 'To stand at the top of a peak that nobody has ever stood before - and to be there with my dad - it was truly an emotional moment.' And while Mr Bonington is all about expanding people's horizons by training them for mountain climbing, desert marathons and long distance treks - he also hopes this helps others to 'get more out of life'. 'What we often forget is that we live in a stunning world and we need to get out there to see it,' he said. 'My clients are not professional athletes.

a044c89a8ecc74e6e2a22e4a58748c254a71a91d,"A whirlwind romance quickly turned into a nightmare for a British grandmother who married a man 20 years her junior in The Gambia. Anne-Marie, 52, from Warwickshire, met husband Omar on a night out when he was in the UK on a student visa. At the time, she was 41 with two children from a previous relationship and he was 21. 'He was handsome and charismatic, he said he'd treat me like a queen and I would never want for anything. He told me everything I wanted to hear,' she told Channel 5 show Love Rats Abroad. Anne-Marie, now 52, from Warwickshire, met husband Omar when she was 41 and he was 21 . She said Omar persistently text and called her after they first met so, in the end, she thought 'why not' and started dating him. Not long after they had been together, he suggested he move into her family home as he couldn't afford the rent on the place where he had been living. Then as his student visa neared its expiration date, they decided to get married just months after they had first met. 'He had come to the country on a student visa, he hadn't been able to finish the course, he needed to send money back home, otherwise people wouldn't be able to eat. I admired him for staying and doing what he had been doing to keep his family going,' Anne-Marie said. 'I entered into the relationship besotted and in love, it was dream.' After a whirlwind romance, the couple married in the Gambia . Anne-Marie's son Joe, who was ten when they got together, said their relationship did seem to move quickly. He said: 'I was young so I didn't know about relationships but it felt quick. I went from seeing him a couple of times a week to him always there and staying.' Anne-Marie and Omar travelled to his native The Gambia to marry in 2006 - but she said she immediately regretted it. 'On my wedding day it was a wonderful day but I had doubts in the back of my mind, I was thinking ""am I doing the right thing?"" Anne-Marie said Omar had been charming and charismatic before they tied the knot . 'The day after we married we had argument, his eyes were bulging, he put his face in mine and said ""you are my wife now, you do as you're told"". I was frightened, I thought ""what have done? I think I've made a big mistake."".' Anne-marie said Omar was aggressive and violent when they returned to the UK and spoke of one harrowing incident - which he denies - when she said he whipped her with a belt. She said: 'He held me to the floor and he took his belt off whipped me over and over on the top of my thigh. I was crying screaming and begging for him to stop and he carried on. I asked ""is this how you control your girlfriends?"" and he shouted ""yes"" back to me.' Anne-Marie said Omar put her under pressure to take out loans so he could send money back to his family in the Gambia. As a result, she racked up debts of £15,000. She said life with Omar was 'awful' with 'spiralling debts' and constant arguments but the marriage lasted for five years before he left. Following the breakdown of her marriage, Anne-Marie is now £16,000 in debt . Now a grandmother of one, she said she hadn't seen him since and is desperate to track him down so he can help her pay off her debts and she can get a divorce. She said: 'I was with this man for a long time and I have debts I can't pay. I want to find him and see if I can get money from him as half of the debts are his. 'Before I met Omar my credit rating was good. Now at the rate I am playing it back,  it will take 17 years to clear the debt.' As the loans were taken out in Anne-Marie's name, she would have to prove she was coerced into taking them out for the debts to be written off. She said: 'Unless I can find out where he is, I can't recover it, I can't even divorce him as I can't serve him the papers.' Channel 5 was able to get a statement from Omar who admitted his marriage had been violent at times but he denied the allegation that he had whipped his wife with a belt. He said he never forced Anne-Marie to take out loans and as far as he is concerned, they are divorced - as he said he secured this in The Gambia in 2012.

3d82bd29961bcedde88ab6fa19a5740585592ff9,"A couple sent their children to a £32,000-a-year private school and rented a house for almost £2,000 a month while claiming £42,000 benefits, a jury was told today. Sarah Grant, received a £40,000 payment from her parents and was drawing income as a director of three companies during the time she and husband Leslie, 67, were claiming benefits, Gloucester crown court heard. The couple, of Cheltenham, claims the firms were in liquidation and deny falsely claiming pension credits, housing benefit and council tax benefit without declaring that they had other income. Couple accused: Sarah and Leslie Grant allegedly sent their children to a £32,000-a-year private school and rented a house for almost £2,000 a month while claiming £42,000 benefits . Prosecutor Tara Wolfe told the court the couple had claimed a total of £42,500 to which they were not entitled. 'While they were in receipt of those benefits they were managing to continue to pay for their children to go to Dean Close School in Cheltenham and to continue to pay for expensive child care and expensive rent,' she said. 'We say they received £19,000 pension credit, £19,000 housing benefit and £4,500 council tax benefit to which they were not entitled. 'We say Mr and Mrs Grant knew they were under an obligation to inform the Department for Work and Pensions and the council of money coming into their accounts which affected their entitlement to benefits. 'The prosecution say they had income coming in from three sources. Between September 2010 and October 2011 Mrs Grant received £40,000 from her parents. 'There was also income from her position as a director of three limited companies that were trading during the material time and which Mr Grant was running. 'And they were using their business accounts for personal expenditure. 'Money from those accounts that was not being declared was being used to pay personal bills, for example their expensive rent and school fees as well as for more day to day things such as shopping.' Top private school: The Grants' children attended £32,000-a-year Dean Close School in Cheltenham while the couple was claiming benefits, the court heard . The three active companies of which she was a director were Hadleigh Partnership, Hadleigh Developments and Sarafino Ltd, she said . The prosecutor said Mr Grant had been receiving pension credit from November 2007 yet he was running the companies of which his wife was director. Investigations into their affairs began when questions were raised about how they were able to pay £1,950 a month rent while receiving housing allowance of only £775 a month, added Ms Wolfe. Mrs Grant was questioned by a benefits official in May 2010 and said her parents had paid the rent shortfall and school fees. She claimed the money paid to her by the companies was to reimburse her for expenses she had paid for the businesses from her personal account. Mrs Grant has held the position of director at eight different companies founded in the last seven years. On trial: Speaking at Gloucester Crown Court (above), prosecutor Tara Wolfe told the court the couple had claimed a total of about £42,500 to which they were not entitled . As well as the three mentioned in court, she was associated with Carousel Group Cheltenham, Sarafinos Estates, Clayhills Development, The Belgian Chocolate Company and D'Altos. All are now listed online as dissolved or in liquidation. Mr Grant was seen in October 2011 and 'spoke a lot about bankruptcy proceedings and legal proceedings in respect of money owed to him,' added the prosecutor. When they had filled out benefit application forms she had said she was a director but the companies were in liquidation. Both defendants, seen leaving court together side-by-side today, say the businesses were not a going concern and both said they did not work. The trial continues tomorrow.

b17e2b9dd6fc8e2fdc6787f28295221c735da0d2,"New parents: Adam Johnson, 27, and Stacey Flounders, 25, have a two-month-old baby, Ayla . The family of a millionaire England footballer say he is 100 per cent innocent and his girlfriend will stand by him after he was arrested on suspicion of having sex with a 15-year-old girl. Adam Johnson - who was signed by Sunderland for £10million in 2012 - was held by police at his six-bedroom £1.8million home in County Durham. Officers also seized a blank firing pistol during the raid. The arrest comes just weeks after his long-term girlfriend Stacey Flounders, 25, gave birth to the couple's first child Ayla Sofia, who was born on January 8. It was unclear if Miss Flounders and her daughter were at home at the time of the player's arrest. And speaking from Miss Flounders' family home, her mother told the Daily Mirror that her daughter and Johnson were still 'very close' and 'absolutely still together'. She added: 'He is 100 per cent innocent and we will stand by him. 'He hasn't been found guilty of anything. He is a great lad and has not done anything wrong. This is a horrible situtation.' The £50,000-a-week player had been due to travel with the rest of the Sunderland squad to East Yorkshire to prepare for tonight’s Premier League game against Hull City. But the club announced he was suspended, ‘pending the outcome of a police investigation’. The FA refused to comment on the arrest of the winger who has represented his country 12 times, although he failed to make the squad for the World Cup in Brazil last year. Residence: Neighbours said they assumed the 27-year-old footballer’s £1.5million property in County Durham (above) had been burgled when they saw activity outside the sprawling mansion . Johnson, 27, gained a reputation as a keen party-goer when he played for Manchester City five years ago. At the time, he was renting Cristiano Ronaldo’s former house near Alderley Edge and would often be seen in the village socialising with fellow players and women. ‘He liked the attention of being a well-known footballer and attracting women was not a problem,’ said one local, who did not wish to be named. ‘He would often leave his car in the village after a night out as he liked a drink and would always get a taxi home.’ But three years ago, after returning to his native North East, Johnson began dating Miss Flounders. Friends say Johnson opted to live near a quiet hamlet to get away from the ‘bright lights’ of city life. Footballer: Johnson is currently playing for Sunderland and has made 12 appearances for the England team . Three unmarked police cars, a police van, several plain-clothed officers and a forensics team were seen at his house as he was questioned at a Durham police station. Johnson’s stunning gated property boasts six bedrooms and a sweeping gravel drive and is set in more than two acres of mature woodland. The house is a typical Footballers’ Wives-style property with Italian stone flooring, and a spiral staircase to a mezzanine level. The master bedroom has an en-suite bathroom, dressing room and balconies at the front and rear while the other five bedrooms are all en-suite. Left: Johnson was released on bail last night and will return to Peterlee police station (pictured) at a later date . It is unclear where the alleged assault is said to have taken place and police would not release any further details. Johnson was born in Sunderland and raised in Easington, County Durham, before joining Middlesbrough’s youth academy as a 12-year-old. After making his Premier League debut for Middlesbrough in 2005 he was sold in February 2010 to Manchester City before being signed three years ago by Sunderland. Last night a Durham Police spokesman said: ‘A 27-year-old man was arrested earlier today on suspicion of sexual activity with a girl under 16. He has been released on police bail pending on-going investigations. ‘A blank firing pistol, which replicates the sound of real gunshots but does not require a licence to own, was also recovered during a search of the property.’ Discussions: Adam Johnson (left) is joined by Frank Lampard (centre) while speaking to the Duchess of Cambridge (right) at the England training facility at St George's Park in Burton upon Trent in October 2012 . Former Middlesbrough star: Adam Johnson has represented England  at senior level 12 times . Adam Johnson began his career at Middlesbrough, where he made his debut in a Uefa Cup game in 2005, aged just 17. Almost six months later, he turned out for the first time in the Premier League, taking part in a 2-1 home win against Arsenal. He was loaned out to Leeds United then Watford, scoring 12 goals in his three-month stay at the Hertfordshire club. On his return to Middlesbrough, he again showed strong form, then made a £7million move to Manchester City in February 2010. In three seasons at the Etihad Stadium, the speedy winger made 97 appearances, helping win the Barclays Premier League, FA Cup and Community Shield. In August 2012 he moved back to his native North East, to Sunderland, in a £10million deal, and highlights of his time there have included a hat-trick on January 11 last year in a 4-1 away win over Fulham. He said after taking the match ball as a memento: ‘These days don't come along too often unless you're Messi or Ronaldo, so it was nice for me to get that ball as a souvenir to look back on. ‘This is up there with one of my best days of my career along with playing for England, scoring for England.’ He was awarded the Barclays Player of the Month award that month. The 27-year-old has represented England at under-19 and under-21 level, and at senior level 12 times, the last of them in a friendly victory over Italy in August 2012. He has struggled to reproduce his best form on a sustained basis at Sunderland, but endeared himself to the fans with goals in each of the club's three derby victories at Newcastle in as many seasons, including a late winner at St James' Park on December 21 last year. Derby win: Winger Johnson scored a late winner against Newcastle United at St James' Park last December .

e7059f9dcbc0ce31dad66ad0541f1fd5da89685d,"From the modesty of bloomers to the seductiveness of lacy corsets, a new exhibition gives us a rare glimpse into the most intimate and private parts of history. The Powerhouse Museum in Sydney have unveiled their 'Undressed: 350 Years of Underwear in Fashion' collection, which features undergarments from the 17th-century to  more modern garments worn by celebrities such as Emma Watson, Cindy Crawford and even Queen Victoria. The exhibition features 81 pieces from the Victoria and Albert Museum in London and includes a  section devoted to the fetish corsets and fur-trimmed designs of racy Australian dominatrix Madame Lash. Scroll down for video . A highlight of the exhibition is this hot pink corset from the 18th century . Apart from a brief stint in Bendigo and Perth, the collection has never been seen by any members of the public before and lead curator Edwina Ehrman believes people will be both shocked and intrigued by what's on display. 'The exhibition focuses on how important underwear has been since the 17th century right through to the present day,' Ms Ehrman told Daily Mail Australia. 'It looks at the way women have used underwear and garments to constrict their body. 'For instance when it was desirable to have a slim waist or broaden their hips.' The collection also takes a look at the more practical aspects of underwear, such as hygiene and keeping women warm in the Winter or cool in the Summer. In the 18th century, proprietary was measured by the type of clothes you wore and while this is very much a fashion exhibition, it also delves into the social aspects of underwear and its status in society. A special section of the exhibition has been dedicated to famous dominatrix Madame Lash . 77 mannequins will showcase over 81 garments at the exhibition. The V&A house over 100,000 items and the collection is particularly strong from the 18th century onwards. The vast majority of the garments come from the museum's own archives however some garments were borrowed from designers to showcase their work. The exhibition is ordered chronologically. The first section covers the practical side of underwear while the second section looks at how underwear was used to fit the body and seduce men. It looks at corsets, targeting in the 18th century and how women's shapes have changed. The bra is then introduced with the girdle and the collection shows how important technology has been in the advancement of undergarments. There is a section which looks at the Victorian period and very closely at the fashions from the 20th century and particularly the 1990s. 'Some of the garments on display have been worn in adverts or fashion magazines to promote underwear and the fashionable body image,' Ms Ehrman said. The key image from the exhibition is that of a hot pink corset with delicate black lace detailing. 77 mannequins will showcase 81 designs from the 17th century onwards, including racy, seductive and functional underwear . It was considered quite racy in the 1890s and was an extremely unexpected colour from that era. 'It was a very high end corset,' Ms Ehrman said. 'It’s covered with silk satin - not cotton or linen - and the brighter the colour in general the more expensive the corset was. It’s quite racy and it’s very much a piece that would have been revealed as a woman undresses. It’s a star item.' A garment that is sure to shock people is the maternity corset from the 18th century. 'People grew up wearing corsets and there were no bras at this time so people would have felt undressed and they would lose their self esteem if they didn't wear a corset,' Ms Ehrman said. 'But it’s very cleverly designed. I love the technology and invention that’s gone into creating the undergarments.' The exhibition has dedicated a whole section to Australian artist and famous dominatrix Madame Lash (Gretel Pinniger). The 70-year-old became famous in the 70's when she opened Sydney's first retail S&M emporium on Oxford Steet called Game Birds. She was a pioneer of her generation and spent years designing and creating intricate corsets and controversial S&M gear. Even now, Ms Pinniger lives and breaths the underworld life and at the opening of the exhibition even decided to wear a white corset adorned with a crown of flowers and a sacred heart which lit up. Some of the garments are sure to shock people but most open up a conversation about the role undergarments play in society . The corset had actually been designed for Pinniger for the Sydney Mardi Gras parade, where she was a celebrant and married three same-sex couples. However she told Daily Mail Australia that she is extremely honoured to be included in the collection and is proud of her work, which she conducted 34-years-ago. 'They have included an exhibition of my work they've had for so long which is a great honour for me,' Ms Pinniger said. 'They were things I made 34 years ago and they've included the painted ones. I did the painting on those garments in the first two weeks of my son’s life.' Ms Pinniger was inspired to venture down the seductive S&M road over 35-years-ago. 'For my own interests - and for others who I hoped would be interested - I was making corsets and corset dresses. Ms Pinniger said she became 'fascinated' with corsetry while on a trip to London with her fiancée at the time. This blue silk corset is a typical style that would have been worn by Queen Victoria  in the 1860s . He took her to a place called Madame Medeq, a famous corset-maker's shop in London. 'It was a very discreet establishment that made purportedly medical corsets but but she ordered out for her clientèle,' Ms Pinniger said. 'I got measured up for two very tight and restrictive corsets and when she finished with me she turned to my fiancée and said ‘and for you sir?’ Ms Pinniger said she was 'completely thrilled' with the whole thing and took her interest back to Sydney where she opened up her own business. 'I took great pain over each garment,' she said. 'I made my clothes in fantasy fabrics and I measured everybody for those garments. I had ideas on the rack but really the business depended on me because they would order from me and I’d design for them.' 'So I made garments for brides,men, Madame Lash and anyone who wanted to live the fantasy life. 'I've always liked people who were different and who wanted to be taken out of their usual selves when they were in my clothing and I succeeded there. A range of garments from such designers as Calvin Klein, Vivienne Westwood and Jean Paul Gaultier will be on display . When she eventually sold her business in 1986 to become a full-time artist, she had a garage sale and each item was snapped up. Now Ms Pinniger says she is extremely grateful that her designs are being honoured at the exhibition. Included in the Madame Lash's collection is a brasserie and g-string and a ruffled white and pink corset designed in 1981. A white leather corset with scalped detail and metal reinforcements is also on display along with women's bloomers and leather cuffs. 'Back then Sydney was not mono-cultural but it certainly wasn't multicultural,' Ms Pinniger said. 'Now in Sydney I see dresses that I would kill to be able to go into a shop to buy. Back then I had to pour ink into nail polish just to get a colour.' 'Everything's very accessible now but the workmanship that goes into real corsets and what I used to put into corsets is what I’d like to see again.' Undressed's core themes include modesty and practicality, decoration and seduction and control and corsetry . Ms Pinniger said people are more adventurous with their undergarments now and believes that her shop would have thrived in the modern world. 'My collection was done 35 years ago and some people have said that they can remember my shop but they were too scared to go in. Now there’s quite a taste for it,' she said. 'I think the things I did back then would definitely work to a much bigger clientèle than I attracted. 'I was there for the love of it, you couldn't say it was majorly profitable. Very often I had to pawn my rings to pay my workers. It was always a bit touch and go.'

In the latest incident Josimar Pacheco, 23, was attacked as he left the stadium after a Peruvian cup game in the District League in the city of Huaraz. His team Sport Ancash Fe had been playing against Deportivo AMVA and were leaving the stadium when a mob of violent fans attacked them. Disturbing images showed the young footballer's being carried from the stadium unconscious before being placed in the back of a car and rushed to hospital. Unconscious: Josimar Pacheco, 23, was attacked as he left the stadium after a Peruvian cup game in the District League in the city of Huaraz . Attack: Disturbing images showed the young footballer's being carried from the stadium unconscious before being placed in the back of a car and rushed to hospital . Josimar Pacheco was placed in the back of a small car and driven to a nearby hospital by his teammates . Speaking to police after the attack, Mr Pacheco said: 'I was separated from the rest of the team and remember somebody grabbing my arm and pulling me into the mob. 'There were just blows raining down on me then, they were punching me and kicking me from every angle,' he added. The footballer passed shortly after the attack began and was only rescued when his teammates saw what was going on and bravely intervened, freeing his limp body from beneath the attackers. Having rescued him from the mob, Mr Pacheco's colleagues released that, frustratingly, all the first aid crews and ambulances on duty at the stadium had already left.

But Mary Berry has revealed there is one animal – horse – she will absolutely not cook or eat because it reminds her of a treasured childhood friend.

So when Mary was first served horsemeat, it reduced her to tears. She explained: ‘At 17 I went away to Pau in the South of France for a few months to study domestic science, including cleaning windows with newspaper and water, while living with a Catholic family with ten children. ‘I’d left my pony at home and on the journey I kept seeing horses’ heads in villages, then the first night the family served me horsemeat and I cried and I cried. Tears poured down throughout the meal but they took little notice. I just hated it. ‘I wasn’t allowed in their kitchen during the day and didn’t go in there at night because there were rats.’ The TV chef had only been introduced to domestic science the year before. In an interview with the Observer Food Monthly magazine, she recalled: ‘My parents went to the head teacher at Bath Grammar when I was 16 and said, “What could Mary do?” and she replied, “I don’t know, very little. Perhaps she could be a child’s nurse.” When Mary was better, she went on to win rosettes with Kerry Lass at pony shows. Above the horse visits her in hospital . In an interview the 79-year-old said she first took up baking at school when domestic science was offered as a subject . ‘And my father said, “I’d pity the child.” But I was in the first bunch of pupils who could choose between Latin and maths and domestic science... and there was a brand new domestic science department. ‘I’d never baked with Mother but when I brought home a treacle pudding, Father said it was as good as Mother made.’ Miss Berry, 79, also said that she struggled with her weight in her younger years. ‘I got chubby as a teen, and then, when my children were young, I was half at home and half at work and there were all their crusts available at home and all my cooking and testing at work, and it all went on my bottom, as it may. ‘But I’ve had my bottom under control for the last few years!’ And the wine-loving presenter revealed that she hasn’t touched a drop of alcohol following her knee-replacement surgery in January. ‘Each night since, my husband has said, “A glass of wine, Mary?” and I’ve said no.

This unusual kitchen gadget promises to do that - because it will transform your oval egg into a round golf ball. The Sports Huevos-Egg Shapers are perfect for sports fans wanting to serve dishes that feature the unmistakable shape of dimpled golf balls and were invented by design company Monkey Business. Scroll down for video . The Sports Huevos-Egg Shaper is able to transform an oval egg into a spherical ball . Tee-time! After just a minute in the gadget your eggs will now look like perfect golf balls . To create the ball-shaped eggs you boil one for a few minutes then allow it to cool enough to be able to peel the shell off. Once the shell is gone you place the warm egg in the shaper, squeeze it shut and submerge it in cold water for a few minutes to set. As it cools the egg takes on the shape of the golf ball. They also come in tennis and football varieties, and each pack of shapers costs £9.95 from Luckies of London. From left to right: To use them just boil an egg, peel off the shell and pop it in a Sports Huevos  Add the ball into a bowl or pan of cold water and leave for a few minutes for the mould to make an impression . Caroline Burman, from Luckies, said: 'Sports Huevos were dreamed up by Israeli design company Monkey Business. 'They come in three styles - golf, tennis and football. 'They're aimed at anyone who wants to make their breakfast more egg-citing. They make a great Easter gift for anyone sporty, even if it's an armchair tennis fan, she said. 'To use them just boil an egg, peel off the shell and pop it in a Sports Huevos while it's still warm. 'Add the ball into a bowl or pan of cold water and leave for a few minutes for the mould to make an impression. 'The reaction to them has been fantastic. 'People love personalising their cooking, and it's a great little gift for sports fanatics at Easter - it certainly makes a healthier alternative to chocolate.'

The Karoto looks and works like an oversized pencil sharpener to peel vegetables such as courgettes and carrots or any similar-shaped vegetable such as the cucumber or parsnip. Its creators also claim the time-saving invention is safer than slicing the skin off vegetables compared to a standard peeler or knife. Karoto was designed by Avichai Tadmor for Monkey Business design studio in Israel. His team claim the Karoto can completely peel a carrot in less than 30 seconds and say that not only does it save time but the shavings can also be used to decorate salads.

Two of the three cases occurred when Reverand Mark Haynes was assigned to St. Ann's parish in Phoenixville and all women were minors at the time, say police. One of those three women said that Haynes attacked her when she confessed that she performed oral sex on a teenage boy. He then made her repeat the sex act on him.

Spokesman Ken Gavin of the Archdiocese of Philadelphia is asking anyone with more information about Hayes to come forward. Recent search terms on Haynes' computer are 'nude teen girls' and '8th grade girls tumblr.' Haynes was charged with multiple counts of sexual abuse of children for possessing and disseminating child pornography last year and last month was arrested by FBI agents after federal prosecutors took over the child-pornography case. MyFoxPhilly.com reports that while posing as his 16-year-old alias he was sending lewd emails to a 14-year-old girl. Police say that Haynes posed as a fictional teenage girl named Katie Caponetti online and that he reached out to 25 teenage girls asking them to send nude photos of themselves. Decades ago: Reverand Mark Haynes allegedly abused three teenage girls while working at St. Ann's parish in Phoenixville in the 1990s . He also swapped hundreds of pornographic images of children online with other online users. Federal prosecutors say that Haynes' arrest last year didn't stop him from soliciting minors. While out on bail and local charges last year, he still used his Katie Caponetti name online while using a personal laptop he kept in the rectory at SS. Simon and Jude's. Despite the new allegations against Haynes he was released on Tuesday and was ordered to pay $5,000 bail at the end of the week. U.S. District Judge Lawrence F. Stengel has scheduled a new detention hearing for Wednesday after prosecutors appealed the decision to let him go. Haynes has served at eight parishes in the Pennsylvania suburbs and also worked as a chaplain at Archbishop Wood High School in Warminster, and at the Office for Youth and Young adults.","Reverand Mark Haynes, 55,  allegedly forced a female into oral sex  in a confessional booth after she confessed to the act on a teenage boy .

fcfacbfabd7a31342b29355a2ee766938d81af9d,"Struck off: Fadi Sukaria joked he could cure a nurse’s intimate medical condition with his ‘magic tongue’ A Syrian dentist who joked he could cure a nurse’s intimate medical condition with his ‘magic tongue’ has been struck off. Fadi Sukaria repeatedly groped his colleague, made sexually explicit comments to her and asked if she had any ‘rude’ pictures or videos on her phone. When he heard she was suffering from cystitis, Sukaria said: ‘I have a magic tongue to make it better.’ His disturbing comments were made while the pair were working together at the Gateway Dental Practice in Barnsley, the General Dental Council (GDC) heard. Sukaria also asked the woman, referred to as Nurse A, if she had ever been raped before stroking her breasts, groping her bottom and biting her arm, the hearing was told. Saba Naqshbandia, for the GDC, said they were working together on November 28 2012, when they chatted about going to the gym. ‘During this Sukaria stroked her bottom very lightly and said it was ""nice"". The complainant responded by saying: ""Don’t ever touch my bum"". ‘He stroked her breast saying: ""I will touch these instead"". She recalled that he was laughing.’ ‘She had to lean next to him, but not over him, to use the computer - as she used the mouse he stroked her right breast again. ‘He grabbed her right arm with his teeth and mouth and sucked it. She said ""how dare you do that"" and he laughed. ‘Later he said: ""I wonder what your bum feels like with jeans on"" and tried to put his hands on her. ‘She recalls being very scared and wondering what he was going to do, by now the complainant was very upset and shocked.’ When she asked another member of staff for a lift home in the evening Sukaria asked if she had ever been raped and added: ‘I’ve never raped anyone.’ The next day she did not attend work, saying she felt unwell. Sukaria also showed another dental nurse - Nurse B - pictures of a woman’s bottom on his phone, saying: ‘Look at that bum, it’s really nice bum.’ He also thrust his groin while laughing, the hearing was told. Giving evidence, Nurse B said: ‘It was a picture of a lady bending over wearing black trousers. He said ""that’s a really nice one to get a hold of,"" and simulated her straddling him with a leg either side. ‘I think he was a bit filthy minded. I don’t think he thought there was anything wrong with what he did even though it was inappropriate.’ Sukaria denied all the allegations against him and fellow dentist Dr Fulya Arda told the hearing: ‘Fadi is a very nice person, he is very trustworthy - I have known him for ten years. His disturbing comments were made while the pair were working together at the Gateway Dental Practice in Barnsley, above, the General Dental Council (GDC) heard . ‘I was very surprised by the allegations. When I read them first I just laughed - there is no way Fadi would do things like this. There is no way I believe them. Sorry.’ Sukaria is the sole breadwinner for his family in Syria as his brother was injured and left paralysed after a bombing, the hearing was told. GDC panel chair Mary Harley said: ‘The committee takes a particularly serious view of your conduct because it took place in a professional setting. ‘Your behaviour towards Dental Nurse A escalated over a short period of time into you deliberately touching her bottom and her breasts and sucking and or biting her arm on 28 November 2012. ‘This escalation continued despite Dental Nurse A making it clear to you that your conduct was unacceptable. ‘Both Dental Nurse A and Dental Nurse B described you laughing during the course of these incidents. ‘As a dentist working directly with these dental nurses, you were in a position of authority over them; you abused that position for your own sexual gratification. ‘Your conduct would be considered deplorable by members of the dental profession and indeed by members of the public.’ Sukaria, of Eastgate, Leeds, was found to have committed a number of offences including making inappropriate and sexual comments and inappropriately touching a nurse.

837b175ef9a1718c691d96bebf1a9fbe3ad833f1,"Louis van Gaal's first season with Manchester United is in danger of turning into a complete mess following the FA Cup defeat by Arsenal. The Dutchman has enjoyed a stellar career but there are signs that he has yet to grasp the demands of the Barclays Premier League and his decisions have left United facing a huge fight to salvage some respectability. Here Sportsmail looks at some of the mistakes that Van Gaal has made. Manchester United manager Louis van Gaal (left) and assistant Ryan Giggs during their  defeat by Arsenal . Why sell Welbeck? There was an inevitability the England striker would return to haunt Van Gaal. United's manager may have been happy to sanction that deal to Arsenal last summer but, in many ways, it was a mistake and shows the shifting values of United. Why did they allow a young English player whose best days are ahead of him to leave and replace him with someone on an extreme salary who was recovering from injury? United as a club develop players. Van Gaal prides himself on working with young talent, so keeping Welbeck should have made sense. The 'Galactico' policy they are pushing doesn't suit them. It caused shock against Arsenal that Falcao was overlooked when United were losing but has the Colombian really done anything to justify being at Old Trafford? Van Gaal's mistake was letting Welbeck leave and bringing in a player who wasn't guaranteed to suit English football. Danny Welbeck shoots to score the winning goal against Manchester United on Monday night at Old Trafford . A stranded David de Gea looks on as the goalkeeper was beaten by former United player Welbeck . Welbeck celebrated his goal against his former club  as Arsenal won the FA Cup tie 2-1 . Messing up in Milton Keynes . So much has happened during this season you could almost forget about the events of Tuesday, August 26. However, Van Gaal made an error that night by selecting a weak team to take on MK Dons in the Capital One Cup. With no European commitments, Van Gaal should have gone full strength to give United a chance of competing for silverware. Instead, he selected six players who are no longer at the club and that 4-0 capitulation increased scrutiny at an early stage. No coach should throw away an opportunity to win a competition but that is what United did against League One opponents. Tumbling out of the FA Cup means this will be the first time since 1989 that United have gone two years without a trophy. United lost 4-0 against MK Dons earlier in the season as Van Gaal played a weak team . MK Dons  striker Benik Afobe celebrates scoring their third goal against United at Stadium MK . No coach should throw away an opportunity to win a competition but Van Gaal did against MK Dons . Not playing to Wayne Rooney's strengths . As Roy Keane observed after the Arsenal defeat, Rooney is 'as good as anyone' when he is deployed in a central striking role. To prove that, he has scored three goals in his last three games and is the one United outfield player who you would genuinely call world-class. But Van Gaal has muddied the picture by playing him deep at times and not utilising his talents. That has had a detrimental effect on results. Rooney, remember, had a spell not long ago when he went nine matches without scoring. Giggs speaks with United captain Wayne Rooney, who has been played out of position previously . Van Gaal has muddied the picture by playing Rooney deep at times and not utilising his talents . What has happened to that style? Keane made another pertinent observation when he said it is 'time to stop looking back at what United had before'. They will not progress as a club if they keep harking back to the good old days of Sir Alex Ferguson. What United have lost, though, is the identity of how they play. At their best, you associate United teams as being fast, dynamic and fearless, always prepared to take risks and stay on the front foot. Has Van Gaal presided over a performance this season that has been universally lauded for attractive football? No. It says everything about them that against Arsenal they finished off hoisting long-balls to Marouane Fellaini and Chris Smalling. United have lacked a good style since Van Gaal took charge during the summer after the World Cup . Firing it up to Fellaini . Fellaini is a good player and he has made a contribution for Van Gaal this season but his continued presence in the team is now proving a hindrance. Liverpool had the issue when Andy Carroll played for them in that it became too easy to smash a ball up to the big presence at the top of the field and United are falling in to that trap. Van Gaal is a coach whose teams historically play attractive football but Fellaini is making United a more primitive outfit. Marouane Fellaini (right) more often than not is told to try to win long balls with his presence up front . How do you solve a problem like (Di) Maria? Picture Angel di Maria in your mind and what do you see? It will probably be of a flying winger hurtling down a flank, the ball stuck to his foot like glue and a defender spinning and swerving to try and cut out the danger. Go back to last season's Champions League final and you will see countless examples. How many times have you see Di Maria do that in a Red shirt? Van Gaal talks of philosophies and systems but doesn't it just make sense to play players in their best positions? Di Maria looked majestic early on in his United career. Lately he looks to be confused by what Van Gaal wants. Angel di Maria is shown a red card during United's defeat at Old Trafford against Arsenal on Monday . Di Maria leaves the field after being sent off during the defeat that was Van Gaal's last chance of a trophy . Changing the formation . Football should, essentially, be a simple game but Van Gaal's tactics can be confusing and nothing shows that up more than whether he is playing three defenders or four. United pass the ball around at the back without really having a purpose and they now have a habit of getting themselves into a panic, as shown by the mistakes that led to Welbeck's goal. It says everything that United's fans sang '4-4-2!' when they played Queens Park Rangers at Loftus Road. Van Gaal's ego meant he was always going to be single-minded in his approach to this job but maybe he has underestimated how true United fans are to traditions. Ripping up a blueprint that had been successful for a quarter of a century has not had the desired effect. United are now too cautious and have lost their speed and threat. It also means they are losing their formidable reputation, too.","Manchester United lost 2-1 against Arsenal in the FA Cup on Monday .

0ef76e78f225c0161d4e4fcb67799ded6fdd2392,"Cleared: Lloyd Erp was acquitted after being accused of murdering his wife Lori in a suicide pact. The scars from where he shot himself are visible . A man charged with murdering his wife during a double suicide pact that went wrong has been dramatically acquitted by a jury. Lloyd Erp has spent more than two years in jail waiting to come to trial over the death of his wife Lori. The court heard how the couple, from Portland, Oregon, had both signed a suicide note saying they wanted to to die on March 2, 2013. Mr Erp told the court that his 52-year-old wife shot herself twice in the head in their bedroom, before he took the rifle and tried to kill himself. He shot himself twice in the head, but survived. Police were called and Lori was found in bed. Mr Erp was arrested and charged with murder, and during the trial prosecutors claimed a post-mortem examination of Lori's body suggested she had been shot by someone else. But on Wednesday Mulnomah County jurors cleared him of murder, after deliberating for less than a day. During the trial, a defence lawyer told jurors the Erps were deeply in love but suffered health problems and addictions to painkillers. They also faced losing their home because neither of them were in work. Mr Erp told the court he still missed his wife terribly, and some days still wants to die, according to a report by OregonLive. An earlier trial saw the jury reach deadlock - because they could not decide whether Mr Erp had shot and murdered his wife - and a mistrial was declared. But during the latest court appearance, prosecution lawyer Tom Cleary urged jurors to follow Oregon law, which said that if they believed Mr Erp fired the fatal shots they must find him guilty of murder. 'This is not a Death With Dignity case,' the prosecutor said. The judge also instructed jurors that Oregon law doesn't define murder as assisting another in committing suicide, such as handing someone a loaded gun. But state law does define murder as committing the actual killing, the judge said -- actually pulling the trigger even if the person wanted to die. Dr Christopher Young, deputy state medical examiner, testified that he determined Lori Erp didn't shoot herself but died by someone else's action. Mr Erp's 52-year-old wife Lori (pictured) was found dead at her home in bed with two shots to her head. Prosecutors alleged Mr Erp had tried to kill her, but he successfully argued that she had shot herself . However defence expert and former medical examiner Dr Michael Propst, said it was unclear whether the woman died by her own hand. Lawyer for the defence Kasla Rutledge added: 'People who are murdered in their sleep by their husbands don't leave suicide notes.' The report in OregonLive added that Mr Erp had not been allowed to attend his wife's memorial service. 'This has been two long years that Lloyd has been in custody, waiting to be exonerated,' Ms Rutledge said. 'He has not been able to grieve. He has not been able to process what happened and his survivor's guilt. And now he gets a chance to do that.'","Lloyd Erp was accused of shooting his wife in Oregon while she was in bed .

Nigel Owens (pictured speaking to England's fly-half George Ford) took charge of Saturday's Six Nations match between England and France . Welsh rugby fan Edryd James has apologised to Owens following a police investigation after homophobic abuse was posted from his Twitter account . 'As part of an agreed Adult Community Resolution, the male apologised to Mr Owens for the offence he had caused at a meeting held at Carmarthen Police Station on Wednesday, March 25. 'An Adult Community Resolution is an alternative way of resolving crimes allowing victims to be involved in deciding how the offender can be dealt with by choosing from a list of out-of-court options. 'The victim must agree to deal with the offence that way and the offender must admit the offence and agree to participate in the process.' Inspecter Stuart Bell added: 'I am satisfied that this matter has been effectively resolved by Dyfed Powys Police with an outcome that was satisfactory for both parties. The person responsible realises his mistake and I’m sure he will have learned from this experience. 'Dyfed Powys Police will not tolerate discrimination of any kind and the public need to realise that if offensive comments are made on social media, they are not above the law and we will investigate the matter as we would any other.' James was in the eye of a storm of controversy after the short message appeared on his account on Saturday evening. The Swansea University student is suspected of posting: ‘Your a gay c*** awful performance against france tonight, how did england top Wales?’ The comment sparked hundreds of replies in which rugby fans of all colours said it was disgraceful and voiced their support for Owens. But James, who lives with his family in Cynwyl Elfed, near Carmarthen, West Wales, claimed his phone had been stolen and he was not responsible. The teenager, who describes himself online in Welsh as a ‘Welshman who enjoys life’, has posted many other comments about his love of rugby and heavy drinking sessions. His mother Meiner James, 58, told the Daily Mail she was ‘aware something has happened’ and said she was ‘trying to get to the bottom of it’. Owens, once named as gay sports personality of the year, was encouraged by many other internet users to report the abuse while others said he should ignore it. The veteran referee – who came out seven years ago – was generally praised for his control of England’s 55-35 victory over France. James, 18, was in the eye of a storm of controversy after the short message appeared on his account on Saturday evening . Owens, who came out as gay seven years ago, replied to the tweet and it was later reported to the police . Among those who spoke out for him were former Wales fly-half Jonathan Davies, Will Carling and Wasps fly-half Andy Goode. Owens later tweeted: ‘An absolute pleasure & privilege to ref one of the best games of rugby ever. Huge credit to England & France for making it a great game.’ It was the first time Owens had taken charge at Twickenham since he received homophobic abuse from the stands during England’s 24-21 defeat to New Zealand in the autumn. On that occasion two people were banned from Rugby HQ for two years and ordered to pay £1,000 to a charity of Owens’ choice.

Trolls who post racist, homophobic and threatening abuse have been dealt with extremely harshly in other high profile cases. Police forces are keen to show that comments made online are as damaging as those made to someone’s face in the street. Last year a Twitter troll was jailed for 18 weeks for bombarding a Labour MP with abusive messages after she supported a successful campaign to put Jane Austen on the £10 note. Peter Nunn, 33, from Bristol, retweeted ‘menacing' posts threatening to rape Stella Creasy, MP for Walthamstow, and branded her a 'witch'. Last month Twitter’s chief executive admitted that the company ‘sucks at dealing with abuse and trolls’ in a leaked memo.

6f3522ef4432c22cf0cae34d0ab04ad5934418be,"This is the moment a group of thrill-seeking skydivers were given the unforgettable opportunity to jump from the bomb bay doors of a military aeroplane. Arranged by Chicagoland Skydiving Center, the special event was enjoyed by 10 people who dropped from the Boeing B-17 Flying Fortress in the skies over Rochelle, Illinois. Exiting the aircraft from 5,000ft, the skydivers each made a donation of $500 (£340) to the Collings Foundation – the non-profit organisation that operates the plane – in order to take part in the jump. One of the skydivers jumps out of the Boeing B-17 Flying Fortress through its bomb bay doors . Each skydiver made a donation of $500 (£340) to the Collings Foundation to take part in the jump . Filmed on GoPro cameras attached to helmets, the video begins with the skydivers boarding the heavy bomber aircraft at an airport in Rockford, Illinois. Developed in the 1930s for the United States Army Corps, the Boeing B-17 Flying Fortress is a four-engine heavy bomber aircraft. The prototype B-17 was designed and built at Boeing’s own expense by a team of engineers led by E. Gifford Emery and Edward Curtis Wells. Boeing chief test-pilot Leslie Tower was at the controls of the Model 299 when it made its maiden flight on July 28, 1935. The name Flying Fortress was used to describe the aircraft because the Model 299 included multiple machine gun installations. The B-17 served numerous USAAF units in combat throughout World War II and was even used by the RAF in non-bomber roles. The B-17 Flying Fortress has become a symbol of power and the America Air Force. Capturing the closed bay doors from the inside of the plane, the video switches to show the aircraft's large propellers starting up before the B-17 leaves the runway. In the air, one of the skydivers checks out the numerous guns attached to the aircraft as well as the two pilots driving it from the cockpit. Before long the B-17 is cruising at around 5,000ft and the bay doors can be seen opening via a camera mounted to the bottom on the plane. Inside the skydivers stand over the opening floor and hold on to the railings on either side as Northern Illinois comes into view below. Waiting for the right moment, the skydivers then begin dropping from the plane at different times – as the camera underneath picks up their rapid exits. The video concludes with footage recorded from a GoPro, which shows the plane moving further away as the skydiver gets closer to the ground. Mike Wood, Chief Operations Officer at Chicagoland Skydiving Center and one of the jumpers in the video, spoke enthusiastically about the experience. One of the skydivers said jumping out of the bay doors was one of the most incredible experiences of his life . The special event was enjoyed by 10 people who dropped from the plane in the skies over Rochelle, Illinois . He told Newsflare: ‘I've been skydiving for more than 30 years and a pilot for more than 20, and the B-17 jump was one of the most incredible experiences of my life. ‘As a pilot and a jumper, it's a privilege to have had a ride in this plane. 'Watching the bomb bay doors open below my feet was a sight I will never forget.’ The Chicagoland Skydiving Center conduct numerous skydives every year with specialty aircraft being brought to its drop zone in Illinois. The Collings Foundation raises money to cover maintenance costs by bringing war planes to air shows across the US.

Lucy Perry, who now heads an international women's health charity, told the child abuse royal commission she was indecently assaulted by the elite Sydney boys school's former headmaster Ian Paterson in 1989 when she was 15. Ms Perry, chief executive of Hamlin Fistula Ethiopia (Australia), said the assault happened in full view of students at the Knox school hall and the boys who saw it 'roared with approval'. Scroll down for video . Former Roseville College student Lucy Perry gave evidence on Monday to the royal commission into child sex abuse . The CEO was surprised by the reaction she caused inside the inquiry, with victims standing up and applauding her as she left . She reported the assault to NSW police in 2009 when allegations about sexual abuse at Knox were emerging. Ms Perry's school, Roseville College, and Knox Grammar had been jointly staging the musical 'Guys and Dolls'. During one rehearsal, Dr Paterson, who the show's producer, singled her out, the commission heard on Monday. As she walked to the edge of the stage 'he placed his hand on my backside'. Ms Perry, who heads Hamlin Fistula Ethiopia, told the commission former headmaster Ian Paterson groped her . 'I would describe it as between a pat and a grope,' Ms Perry told the commission. 'He then slid his hand right down to cup my buttocks and [I] felt him touch my genitals outside of my clothing.' Ms Perry continued: 'I was humiliated in front of the boys and I heard the boys cheering. 'I was disgusted with Paterson's behaviour and thought he was demonstrating to the Knox boys that it was perfectly acceptable, even admirable, to be disrespectful to girls.' The now 41-year-old , who was in her teens at the time of the 1989 incident, said students cheered when he touched her bottom and genitals . Ms Perry, now 41, was not interested in pressing charges against Dr Paterson but changed her mind in 2009. 'I wanted to let police know that I was happy to provide a statement if it was going to be useful to demonstrate the culture of disrespect engendered by the school and to highlight the environment and attitudes fostered by the headmaster,' she said. Dr Paterson's solicitor Jim Harrowell asked her if the headmaster was just positioning her on the stage. 'I would suggest to you Mr Harrowell that positioning girls by their bottoms is not the best way to do that,' she said. The chief executive was applauded by Knox victims and their supporters as she left the hearing in Sydney . Ms Perry was applauded by Knox victims and their supporters as she left the hearing in Sydney. Later she tweeted: 'I did not expect a standing ovation when I walked out of the Royal Commission today. Survivors are much braver than me.' Earlier on Monday, David Lloyd, counsel assisting the commission, said there was no evidence to support an allegation made during evidence on Friday that the Uniting Church's former moderator James Mein and solicitor Rob Wannan, who was the former chair of the Knox council, were involved in the destruction of sensitive documents. Mr Lloyd does not intend to recommend a finding they were involved. The Royal Commission into Institutional Responses to Child Sexual Abuse inquiry into Knox continues on Tuesday.

36fb18b369a87c479c31fab2e89771d7a821cd58,"A tiny Scottish restaurant that's open only six months a year, has been crowned the joint winner of the UK's most sustainable venue by the 2015 Sustainable Restaurant Awards. Beating highly acclaimed restaurant's The Hawksmoor, The Pig and Italian chain Carluccio's, sea-food venue The Captain's Galley, run by husband and wife team Mary and Jim Cowie, was praised for its green credentials alongside Daylesford, which runs three organic cafes. Situated in Scotland's most north-eastern county of Caithness, The Captain's Galley lies in the town of Scrabster, a 30-minute drive from the airport of Wick. Jim Cowie's The Captain's Galley has beaten  top eateries to be named the top sustainable venue in the UK . Mary Cowie, left, tends to the herbs in the restaurant's poly tunnel, while Jim Cowie, right, prepares an oyster in the venue's sustainable kitchen . The couple  renovated the town's old  Ice House and Salmon Bothy in 2001 - dating back to the early 1800s - and opened their doors in October 2002. They worked exclusively with local tradesmen to build the 30-seat restaurant, and saved one of Caithness's most interesting buildings from falling into ruin. All of  the restaurant's seafood is from wild, sustainable non pressure stock species, in season, from local like minded, inshore fishermen. 'Few restaurants can boast that their supplier and best friends  are all the same people,' says Jim Cowie. The Captain's Galley is situation in Scrabster, Caithness, one of the most northern points of Scotland . The cosy Old Bothy is where guests have drinks before sitting down to their meal in the restored Ice House . 'We think more of our customers than to fill them up with chemicals [from fish farms] of which nobody knows the long-term effects.' Mr Cowie was a fish auctioneer on fish markets for 35 years. He saw the decline of the fish industry years ago and at the age of 52 decided to completely change career. He went to the North Highland College to train as a chef, and his wife Mary gave up her nursing career of 30 years to work beside her husband as front of house. Their son Ashley, a TV host on The History Channel and recently dubbed 'Scotland's Indiana Jones' is also a director of the company and is as hands on as possible when he is up from London. 'From time to time, on a full moon, I go rod fishing for wild sea trout,' he says. 'It is so delicious and Dad is thrilled when I bring some home for him to cook for the restaurant.' An expert in local history, Ashley explains the suitability of the restaurant: 'Caithness was the first area in the UK to adopt farming as a lifestyle around 4000BC.' 'The Captains Galley maintain this tradition by selecting and serving the best veg from the richest agricultural soils in the UK. 'My father is a more a craftsman than a chef. Where most chefs spoil fish by over cooking it and smothering it with sauces, he gently cooks the fish and let's the wild sea taste speak for itself.' All of the restaurant's seafood is from wild, sustainable non pressure stock species . Mr Cowie goes down to the docks every morning to personally hand pick the fish for his restaurant . TV host Ashley Cowie, the owners' son, is a director of The Captain's Galley and goes fishing for the kitchen . 'I wake up at 6am and pick herbs and green leaves from our poly tunnel,' he says. 'I then drive around Caithness handpicking veg from organic growers, and i'm at the fish market at 10am where I buy  fish and shellfish directly from fishing boats.' Nothing is wasted at the restaurant and almost everything is grown by the couple. 'We have chickens at our cottage which provides the restaurant's eggs,' explains Mrs Cowie, 'and we grow fennel, rosemary, thyme, raspberries, strawberries, garlic and lemongrass ourselves.' The Ice House seats 30 people and its domed ceiling adds to the romance of the remote loaction . 'We aim to achieve zero waste hence recycle and reuse as much as possible,' explains Mr Cowie. 'We reuse paper, cardboard, glass, plastics, cans, and recycle small electrical items.' Mr Cowie smokes all of his own fish by hand outdoors on a smoke machine he built himself. 'I keep used egg cartons for my fish smoker and the centre of toilet rolls to support young plants. 'All our wild game and seafood arrive whole, we adopt the nose to tail approach using every part, using the bones for stocks,' he says. 'When filleting I select the most suitable for my fish stock, the rest are given to my crab and lobster boats and used for baiting their creels. Mr Cowie's menu is filled with fresh seafood and locally sourced Scottish ingredients . Jim Cowie and Angela Mackay from the Kyle of Tounge Oysters collecting seaweed, winkles and oysters . 'We also filter the oil in our fish and chip pans, keeping it clean and healthy, adding fresh as required,' he says. 'I even run my car on the old oil from the restaurant!' At certain times of year when the specific foods are in season, Mary and Jim can be found down on the shore sourcing food. 'We collect winkles, oysters and seaweed which  Jim uses for his home made sushi served in the restaurant,' says Mrs Cowie. Open from Easter to October to accommodate the short tourist season, reduce energy expenditure and because of the seasonality of the food, The Captain's Galley has welcomed diners from a far afield as Australia and North America through its doors. 'We always can help them find accommodation,' says Mr Cowie. 'Our favourite spots are sustainable guesthouses Pentland House and Pennyland House in Thurso, a few minutes down the road.'

Sometimes the sponsors' choice is met with bewilderment, even derision. Not this time. The reaction was warm applause from all four corners of the stadium - universal acknowledgement and appreciation. Welbeck had been excellent, by some distance the stand-out player. Direct and deadly, this was Danny at his game-changing best. Who needs Harry Kane? Danny Welbeck leads the celebrations after putting England 2-0 ahead against Lithuania on Friday . Welbeck's header deflects into the back of the net to send England into a commanding lead . Welbeck is congratulated by England captain Wayne Rooney after scoring his sixth of the qualfying campaign . Welbeck's pitch map from the Lithuania match shows his influence right across the front line . Welbeck has scored eight goals in 29 appearances for Arsenal this season but has six in four qualifiers for England. On a productive night, Welbeck blasted in the shot that led to Wayne Rooney's opener, stooped to divert home England's second, had three other shots on goal and tormented the Lithuanian defence with his pace, power and passing. The goal augmented his international goal tally to 14 - drawing level with Paul Scholes - and he duly became the leading scorer in Euro 2016 qualifying with six goals, one ahead of Israel's Omar Damari. Welbeck's touch map showed his influence right across the field, switching places with Rooney and Raheem Sterling in a dynamic front three that linked up seamlessly throughout. The only dampener on the evening was the knee injury that will force him out of Tuesday night's friendly with Italy in Turin. Which all begs the question - why doesn't Welbeck play like this for Arsenal? Welbeck caused the Lithuanian defence problems all evening and justified his selection .

The fact his England goal tally for the campaign is just two shy of his club return speaks volumes - perhaps Arsene Wenger should ask Roy Hodgson for advice on how to get the best out of the frontman. Because he looks a man transformed on international duty - while with Arsenal, the wide berth is regarded as something of a snub, inhibiting his performance. With England it somehow plays to his strengths. With the Three Lions on his chest, Welbeck is content and confident, raising his game to a level rarely seen for the Gunners. There he can be aloof, slow and ineffective. The memes that often go viral on Twitter portraying Welbeck as a World Cup winner or with the Ballon d'Or are very much tongue-in-cheek but he can rise above the mockery. At the moment, Welbeck is unlikely to displace Giroud, who has 17 goals in 26 games this season, but Friday night's electric performance proves that he can perform in a wide position - on both flanks. Wenger should liberate him and say 'you're playing wide for the foreseeable future, but make it your own. Get the head down, get the legs pumping. When you run at opposition defences, it is a frightening proposition. Inevitably, positive play will lead to more goals. And more goals will lead to a sustained title challenge.'

The deadly haul, brought into the country by passengers arriving in Australia, included flick knives, knuckle dusters and a crossbow. The grenade launcher, believed to be from Russia, was one of the more alarming finds. Heavily armed: Knuckle dusters, nunchuks and a grenade launcher were among the weapons seized from January 1 to March 4 . Figures released by the Australian Customs and Border Protection Service state that over 30 real and imitation firearms were seized from airline passengers. Passengers could face a $425,000 fine or 10 years in prison for importing dangerous goods without permission. Authorities say that people must be starting to understand these kinds of weapons won't be let into the country after they saw a drastic decrease in the number of weapons seized from 2013 to 2014. Last year 1,318 illegal weapons were discovered, a significant drop from the 3,075 seized in 2013. Assistant Minister for Imm­igration and Border Protection, Michaelia Cash, told Perth Now that it's overseas vendors that are to blame for selling the weapons to Australians under the guise they will make it across the border. Authorities say Australians are being deceived by international vendors who lead them to believe the weapons will make it home . 'People may think that items such as laser pointers, flick knives, and shock devices make for an impressive souvenir but they could end up costing you more than you bargained for,' Senator Cash said. She recommends that travellers make sure they understand the restrictions placed on what comes through customs so they don't end up throwing their hard earned cash away. 'Every year, travellers are losing their hard-earned money by bringing items and gifts back into Australia that they can't keep. 'If you bring these things back they'll be seized. You'll lose the item, waste your money and may face a ­penalty.' Airports aren't the only target with reports claiming firearms are being trafficked through the mail . In an annual report, by the Australian Customs and Border Protection Service, it was found that the number of undeclared handguns detected by customs had skyrocketed by 60 per cent. The report advised people are using the mail to conceal and deliver handguns in illicit firearm trafficking networks. Authorities maintain that identifying and dismantling these networks is a 'high priority'. 'We have strengthened our targeting regimen and enhanced opportunities to increase detection of illicit firearms,' the report said.","Over 300 illegal weapons have been seized from Perth Airport since January 1 .

Having edged out their round-four tie at the Millennium Stadium, Gatland’s side are still in the hunt for the championship but they must better the points difference of both England and Ireland to top the standings. Wales have won their last seven meetings against the Azzuri, however they will have to prepare for the tie at the Stadio Olimpico with major fitness concerns over Jamie Roberts, Richard Hibbard, Gethin Jenkins and Samson Lee. Wales coach Warren Gatland has warned his team to focus on winning against Italy before running up a score . A delighted Wales team celebrates keeping their 2015 RBS Six Nations title hopes alive with victory . ‘If you go in with an attitude that we need to score, 20, 30 or 40 points then we’ll get caught with our pants down and be rolled over,’ said Gatland. ‘It will be tough for Italy with a six-day turnaround. Italy are not a bad side. It’s important to do a job up front and accumulate points. ‘It could come down to the last 15 or 20 minutes. It will be nice to go there and get a win and hopefully win by a few. We’re first up at the weekend so we’ll see how the other teams react afterwards. It puts us under some pressure but hopefully it puts England and Ireland under some pressure too.’ England face a potential banana-skin tie against France, while Ireland have a trip to wooden spoon favourites Scotland. Like Gatland, Ireland coach Joe Schmidt will also approach the closing weekend with caution. The Kiwi coach found himself in a similar situation 12 months ago, when he pipped the English to the title with a dramatic victory at the Stade de France. Sam Warburton gives a thumb up after an heroic defensive effort from Wales in their win over Ireland . Warburton makes a run at Ireland hooker Rory Best at the Millennium Stadium on Saturday . ‘I suppose it’s a bit similar to last year, when we just knew we needed the result in Paris,’ said Schmidt. ‘That’s something we managed to do and we won the championship on the back of it, and England had to sit and watch. But you’ve got to beat those teams first. I don’t think you can afford to go anywhere and start chasing points . . . Scotland are going to be very difficult to beat.’ Last night’s defeat in Cardiff was not how Paul O’Connell hoped to celebrate his 100th Test. The 35-year-old was outfoxed at the line-out by Alun-Wyn Jones and Luke Charteris, admitting that he is itching to right those wrongs at Murrayfield next week. ‘The guys are very disappointed but it’s not up to Joe or me or anyone to lift anyone, it’s up to individuals to lift themselves,’ said O’Connell. ‘One thing about losing is that you just want to get out there and play again as soon as you can.’ Gatland praised his medical team for introducing a ‘spotter’ who flagged up Hibbard’s head injury. Richard Hibbard was withdrawn after his head injury was spotted by video analysis and doctors alerted . Following the controversy of George North’s concussion against England, chief medical manager Prav Mathema moved to increase his resources to deal with the issue. Hibbard’s 78th-minute injury was picked up on video analysis equipment, with the spotter subsequently ordering the team doctors via radio to remove the hooker from the pitch. ‘Prav has put in place a spotter with video access,’ said Gatland. ‘It’s pleasing because there’s been so much said about concussion.’","Wales beat Ireland to keep Six Nations challenge alive .

ee701595f6d4996b4bfa68ebf62d033c0df6d942,"Richard Johnson's striking blue eyes water as bright sunlight floods into the Royal Box at Newbury Racecourse and he casts his mind back to a Monday night in Stratford almost 21 years ago. ‘That was the first time I met him,’ he says. ‘He was a lot skinnier and younger looking, as we all were. It was my first year as an amateur and his first as a conditional because he’d been riding on the Flat in Ireland for a couple of years. It was towards the end of the season and he’d already ridden 70-odd winners and I had 10. But even before that I’d heard people saying “This Anthony McCoy rode a winner today, he was amazing”. It takes very little time in the racing world for word to get around. He was getting horses to win that other people couldn’t and all the people that you want to be talking about you were talking about him.’ If AP McCoy had been a postman, a plumber or a professor, Johnson would probably be talked about as the greatest jump jockey ever. He has been runner-up 15 of the 19 times McCoy has been champion jockey and that figure will probably be 16 come the end of the season. Johnson’s tally of nearly 2,800 winners far outstrips the totals of giants of the game such as Richard Dunwoody, John Francome and Peter Scudamore, all of whom won the title at least three times. Richard Johnson would be talked about as one of the greatest jump jockeys ever if it weren't for AP McCoy . Johnson has finished runner-up to McCoy in the race to be crowned champion jockey 15 times . When McCoy retires at the end of the season Johnson, 37, is favourite to finally achieve his dream but there is no hint of bitterness at the years of playing second fiddle. ‘My main ambition has always been to be champion jockey and AP has been the thorn in my side for a long time,’ he says. ‘But it’s not his fault. It’s my fault that I haven’t ridden more winners than him. I find it slightly strange when people say, “Now he’s retired you can give it a real kick”. I go for it every day of the week, every year. I’ll start off the first day of next season as always. ‘Obviously without AP it’s definitely going to help but you’ve got a host of young jockeys like Tom Scudamore, Sam Twiston-Davies, Aidan Coleman and older ones like Noel Fehily and Jason Maguire so there’s going to be no easy run of it.’ Johnson has ridden nearly 2,800 winners during his career but never been champion jockey . Johnson rides Royale Django as he wins Ladbrokes 'National Hunt' Novices' Hurdle at Southwell Racecourse . McCoy celebrates after winning the Cheltenham Gold Cup on Synchronised in 2012 . McCoy has often credited the pressure Johnson puts on him for motivating him to ride on wet winter evenings as well as at the big occasions like the Cheltenham Festival. In 2009 he wrote: ‘Having Dickie as an adversary has, more than anyone else, spurred me on to ride more winners. The threat of him beating me to the title has made me more driven.’ At this, Johnson chuckles. ‘I’m not sure about that, I’ve just chased him a lot,’ he says. ‘It’s like running with Usain Bolt, he’s just turning back and laughing as he’s moving away.’ Many of the great sporting rivalries of the past have been characterised by sniping and swiping. But Johnson claims there is no room for that in racing, where jockeys know the perils every time they line up at the start and on a more basic level, they have to live with each other day in, day out. ‘The valets set up our gear every morning. It doesn’t matter how many winners you’ve ridden, it’s how long you’ve been riding. Because we started at the same time we’re usually sat next to or near each other. The longer you’ve been there the closer you get to the door. He’s been pushed out and I’m going to be next to the door. Cloud Creeper ridden by jockey Richard Johnson jumps the last to win Nicol & Fielding Mechanical Services Ltd Steeple Chase at Leicester Racecourse on Friday . McCoy credited pressure from Johnson as his motivation for riding so many winners . ‘Through the winter when we’re racing seven days a week there’s every chance we’ll be at the same meetings for days on end. I leave home at 4am and get back at 7pm. I rarely see my children [Willow six, Casper three and Percy, one] awake during the winter. I definitely see AP more than my children and probably my wife, Fiona.’ Johnson grew up on an arable and cattle farm in Hereford. He rode ponies as a child and as a teenager spent summers working at David Nicholson’s yard. ‘He offered me a job when I left school at 16,’ says Johnson, ‘I think my parents thought I’d go for two years, see a bit of life then go to agricultural college and come back and be a farmer.’ He would read copies of the racing newspaper Sporting Life, now defunct, at breakfast time. ‘Peter Scudamore was from the same county so I looked up to him,’ says Johnson. ‘When I understood racing a bit more Richard Dunwoody was the man I looked up to. He’s still someone I look up to today. Even though I’ve won more races, to be champion jockey would make me feel I belong in that bracket.’ The Cheltenham Festival is live on Channel 4.

d5f69aec26d31be603324d3496155fcce2ea03b0,"Stoke, under the management of Tony Pulis, became the team everyone hated and everyone hated to play against. But if there is something worse than being hated, it is being ignored and that is where we are with Mark Hughes’ Stoke side now. While the physical nature of the team Pulis built brought incendiary headlines, critical comment and damning statistics – I was the captain of his team in the Championship from 2004-2007 – the progress made by Hughes has been overlooked. Stoke stars Mame Diouf, Jon Walters and Steven Nzonzi celebrate during the Potters' 2-0 win over Everton in the Barclays Premier League on Wednesday which lifted them to eighth in the table . Stoke have collected 23 points from a possible 33 since Boxing Day. Only Liverpool and Arsenal have picked up more, so why isn’t there more attention to their achievements? When Stoke beat Everton this week to rise to eighth place in the Barclays Premier League, the aftermath wasn’t about how well Stoke are doing but instead about the struggling Roberto Martinez and Everton. Stoke are the team who are above Garry Monk’s Swansea – recently championed after their defeat of Manchester United – West Ham, Newcastle and the rest of the bottom ten. Southampton have exceeded everyone’s expectations this season and receive weekly reviews as the nation’s romance story; neutrals want them to do well, to upset the normal order of the top four. But what is it about Stoke City Football Club, who are as high as they can probably ever wish to be, that generates such little media attention or positive write ups? Stoke, as a city, finds itself situated between the bigger and more glamorous cities of Manchester and Birmingham, but it has a lot to offer. Stoke's Michael Duberry tracks Wigan striker Nathan Ellington during a Championship match at the Britannia Stadium in November 2004, which was the defender's first season at the club . Crystal Palace striker Andy Johnson tries to take evasive action as Duberry jumps across to make a tackle during Stoke's 3-1 home defeat by the Eagles in March 2006 . Duberry stands all smiles at the Britannia Stadium during his time as a Stoke player. It was a period in the defender's career where he admits he felt wanted by the club in his three-year spell which ended in 2007 . When I moved to Stoke from Leeds, the city didn’t have a Harvey Nichols or some of the swanky restaurants I left in Leeds, but it didn’t matter. The club gave me a home and a place. I felt wanted - I didn’t want anything else. I moved near the training ground in nearby Newcastle Under Lyme and was very happy. I had Trentham Gardens, Hanley Shopping centre and Alton Towers was on my doorstep too. Back when I was a Stoke player the club always seemed to have a power struggle going on upstairs. There was a lack of a clear vision as to who was in charge and the direction in which they wanted to take the club. Then Peter Coates took over in 2006 and the vision became clear. A Stoke boy and self-made millionaire, Mr Coates has the club at heart and never hides that love. He has made some wise appointments to manage the football team. Stoke were promoted to the Premier League under the management of Tony Pulis, with Duberry playing under the now West Brom boss while at the Potters in the Championship . Pulis arranges a training drill at Stoke's training ground in 2012. Duberry described the sessions as regimented and boring, but admits it made the team play better on match days . Since Mark Hughes has taken over, the club have only spent £10m in the transfer market, which is a tremendous job in the current climate of spending. Stoke have become quite successful in finding players to fit the mold, with Hughes and his staff working with head of recruitment Mark Cartwright. They don’t overspend and yet they have created and established a Premier League team. Finishing 12th,11th, 14th and 13th twice since coming into the Premier League, last season was their highest-ever. with a 9th place finish. But now they are one place higher and playing a more attractive passing style. During my first spell under Tony Pulis, we were very direct, often going back to front in less than two passes. Training was regimented, often just walking through team shape and then doing set pieces. I didn’t like it and found it boring but it made us better on match days and I loved the feeling of a clean sheet. Stoke attracted criticism for their direct style of play after being promoted to the Premier League in 2008, with teams forced into having to form defensive tactics against long Rory Delap throw ins . Mark Hughes gives advice to Stoke's Glenn Whelan during a league game against Liverpool, and Duberry claims the Potters have improved their style of play having spent little money under the Welshman . The next season under Johan Boskamp, everything was totally different. The Dutch manager had a pure footballing philosophy and every training session was 100 per cent football. I loved everything from the training, to the games and to the way he spoke football . When Pulis came back the following season, it reverted back to the old regime of pattern of play and set pieces in training. It was very frustrating . It’s a different club now with a different manager and a different footballing ethos. You never see Mark Hughes in the technical area signaling to his players to pass from back to front, but instead he is gesturing to pass the ball and it looks as if the players are enjoying the experience. I believe they deserve more credit and exposure. But if that doesn’t happen, then I’m sure the loud choruses of ‘Delilah’ from the fans will drown out any negative, stereotypical opinions outside.","Stoke City were hated by everyone under management of Tony Pulis .

c19cedb67b0321173295fe0c54b726880cc2fe14,"Tour de France winner Chris Froome has welcomed 24-hour drug testing in cycling. Froome's comments come in the wake of a damning report by the Cycling Independent Reform Commission to address doping in the sport and criticism from Olympic champion Nicole Cooke that the 2013 Tour de France winner was allowed a therapeutic use exemption to compete at the Tour de Romandie last year. 'I for one welcome 24hr testing. It may be an inconvenience but if it can help clean up the sport that I love lets do it,' Froome said on his official Twitter account. Champion cyclist Chris Froome says he would welcome 24hour drug testing in the sport he loves . Froome trains for Team SKY in the mountains of Alcudia, Spain in January . Cooke has called on cycling's governing body, the UCI, to do more to police the 'disturbing grey area' of TUEs and believes Team Sky rider Froome should not have been granted a TUE for a powerful corticosteroid to compete at the 2014 Tour de Romandie after complaining of chest pains. The former Olympic and world road-race champion who retired from cycling two years ago, wrote in The Guardian that UCI president Brian Cookson should apologise to the rest of the riders in the race for failing them. 'I don't think it is at all right that Chris should have the race and prize money taken off him retrospectively, but Cookson needs to issue a very clear message: he should be apologising to the rest of the riders for failing them,' Cooke said. 'That TUE application should not have been approved; Froome and Sky should have had a clear choice of either riding without steroids or pulling out. 'I never found I could be anywhere near the front of a long race when I was ill.' Froome has been criticised for winning the 2014 Tour de Romandie while taking therapeutic drugs . The Sky cyclist's greatest achievement thus far has been winning the 2013 Tour de France . The CIRC report, published on Monday, showed how the culture and previous practices of the UCI allowed Lance Armstrong to cheat, including the retrospective issuing of a TUE to cover up a positive test at the 1999 Tour de France. When the granting of Froome's TUE came to light last June, the UCI and the World Anti-Doping Agency said procedures had been properly followed. But Cooke feels Cookson should not leave himself open to a situation where he could be accused of favouring a Sky rider - 'the Sky team of which Cookson was a founding board member,' she said. However, Cookson said the rules had subsequently been tightened to ensure all TUE applications went through an independent committee. 'Ms Cooke's accusation is simply wrong,' said Cookson, who since ousting Pat McQuaid as UCI president has overseen the CIRC report that sought to shed light on cycling's darkest days and introduced new anti-doping measures. Former Olympic gold medalist Nicole Cooke has criticised Froome for racing while taking therapeutic drugs . 'I made it a firm pledge that I would separate myself from all anti-doping processes, specifically to avoid any potential conflict of interest, both for me personally and for the UCI in its role as governing body for the sport. 'And I have lived up to that pledge. 'When it came to our attention that we were following an outdated procedure, we looked again at our processes and in order to ensure absolute integrity. 'The UCI confirmed in June 2014 that all TUE decisions must pass through the TUE Committee and be approved by three members unanimously, which is a stronger commitment than what is required by the international standard for therapeutic use exemptions. 'This has added an extra layer of accountability to the decision-making process.'","The 2013 Tour de France winner would welcome 24hr drug testing .

The video shows Abase Hussen marching at the front of the demonstrators, behind a banner reading: 'The followers of Mohammed will conquer America'. He was filmed chanting 'Allahu Akbar' amid dozens of protesters and standing just yards away as the American flag is burned. Scroll down for video . Vicious: In 2012, Abase Hussen (left) marched at the head of a violent rally held by Muslim extremists in London, taking part in the burning of an American flag . Cuddly: Hussen appealing for the return of his 'jihadi daughter' a few weeks ago after she ran off . Earlier this month, Mr Hussen blamed police for placing a 'heavy burden' on his daughter by handing her the letter about their inquiry - and the police apologised. Yesterday, a Government report on foreign fighters was released containing testimony from Mr Hussen. But at no time has he mentioned his own passion for militant Islam or attendance at one of the most notorious rallies of the last few years. Hannah Stuart, domestic extremism expert at the Henry Jackson Society, said: . 'We saw Mr Hussen on TV looking very innocent, holding a teddy bear. But he was linked with individuals who espouse an extremist ideology. 'The impression given was that Islamic extremism was an alien world to his daughter. This footage suggests it wasn't.' Mr Hussen's daughter, Amira Abase, 15, fled the UK with two of her closest friends to join Islamic State last month sparking a national outcry. Mr Hussen, who is originally from Ethiopia, led public appeals for her return as their families blamed the authorities for failing to stop them. He addressed MPs at the Home Affairs Select Committee and was filmed appealing for help while clutching his daughter's teddy bear. Last night, Scotland Yard said it would examine the footage to see if any criminal offences had been committed. Sinister: Also at the rally was Michael Adebowale who went on to murder soldier Lee Rigby the following year . Respectable: Abase Hussen, pictured far right, giving evidence to the Home Affairs Select Committee following his daughter's disappearance. The report was released this week . A spokesman said: 'We will review any material brought to our attention which purports to show any criminal offence taking place.' Radical: Amira Abase, 15, daughter of Abase Hussen, travelled to Syria with two other girls . Mr Hussen was caught on camera in one of a wave of terrifying demonstrations that took place across the world in September 2012. Two men were arrested as the angry mob called for shariah law to be imposed across the UK. Amira Abase fled the UK with her friends Shamima Begum, 15, and Khadiza Sultana, 16, last month. The trio were following in the footsteps of a fourth girl from their school, Bethnal Green Academy, in East London, who left for Syria in December. Their decision to throw themselves into the hands of the brutal Islamic State terrorist group sparked a national outcry. Prime Minister David Cameron led calls for everyone to examine what is motivating our young people to join the barbaric organisation. Earlier this week Mr Hussen travelled to Turkey with relatives of the other two girls. He has since returned to the flat he shares with his wife in East London but could not be contacted last night. Speaking while in Turkey, he said: 'I don't know how to explain. I can't describe my feelings. 'I feel like my girl is next to me when I find someone that's on their last journey who saw them. I feel like my daughter is next to me – that's the feelings I have.' Thousands took to the streets to protest against an obscure film called Innocence of Muslims, which was criticised for ridiculing Islam. In London, more than 150 clashed with police outside the U.S. Embassy in Mayfair as they chanted 'burn, burn USA' and 'Allahu Akbar' (God is great). Images posted online show Mr Hussen at the head of the march, reaching towards an Israeli flag as it is burned. A U.S. stars and stripes was also set on fire. His distinctive face can also be seen as the march moves along the street beside a line of police carriers and officers. Among the rabble-rousers at the march was notorious hate preacher Choudary, with Adebowale at his side. Chilling: A CCTV image of 15-year-old Amira Abase, Kadiza Sultana,16, and Shamima Begum,15 at Gatwick Airport before they caught their flight to Turkey .

The demonstration, held in 2012, was led by firebrand preacher Anjem Choudary and attended by Lee Rigby's killer .

On Monday, Dutch newspaper De Telegraaf reported that Astana would lose their WorldTour licence and would only be allowed to apply for a Continental licence, the third tier of professional cycling, saying the decision had been made on March 20. The Astana cycling team have denied reports they have been stripped of their WorldTour licence . The Licence Commission is due to meet with Astana on Thursday, and the team said they believed that meeting would mark the start of the decision-making process, with no verdict yet in place.

'We aim to present evidence that Astana Pro Team is in full compliance with the ethical codes in place and is taking pro-active measures to enhance our role in the global fight against drugs in cycling.' When Astana were awarded their 2015 licence in December, conditions were attached after five riders linked to the team failed doping tests in 2014, including brothers Maxim and Valentin Iglinskiy, trainee Ilya Davidenok and two members of Astana's continental development team - Artur Fedosseyev and Victor Okishev. On Monday, Dutch newspaper De Telegraaf reported that Astana would lose their WorldTour licence .

3dc5a48ddf58a67ff2ab3073623ea2c6bb4a826c,"We feed them, groom them, clothe them and otherwise shell out the big bucks to protect and pamper our pets. The American Pet Products Association's annual report on pet industry spending says Americans spent $58 billion in 2014 on their 397 million pets, which range from freshwater fish and reptiles to cats and dogs. The industry trade group released the survey Thursday at the Global Pet Expo, an annual trade show in Orlando, Florida. The data came from a variety of groups, market research studies and media reports. The American Pet Products Association's annual report on pet industry spending says Americans spent $58 billion in 2014 on their 397 million pets, which range from freshwater fish and reptiles to cats and dogs . Here's a snapshot of how we spend money on pets: . WHERE THE MONEY GOES . The association measures five areas of spending. Last year, people spent $22 billion on food; $15 billion on veterinary care; $14 billion on supplies such as beds, bowls and collars and over-the-counter medicine to fight ailments such as fleas, ticks and colds; $4.8 billion on other services; and $2 billion on animals themselves. The 'other services' category grew the fastest in 2014 and includes payments on grooming, boarding, walking, training, day care and even trips to the spa — where pets can get facials and massages, said Bob Vetere, president and CEO of the pet products association, based in Greenwich, Connecticut. Food:  $22.62 billion . Supplies/OTC Medicine: $13.72 billion . Vet Care:  $15.25 billion . Live animal purchases:  $2.19 billion . Grooming & boarding: $4.73 billion . The breakdown of pet expenses above is an estimation by the American Pet Products Association based on its annual report on pet industry . VET VISITS FLAT . The report says trips to the veterinarian were unchanged or slightly down last year, although expenditures per visit have increased as owners green-light more expensive procedures, Vetere said. Those treatments ranged from the lifesaving to the exotic, like plastic surgery. A robust human-animal bond still exists, especially with dogs and cats, and people are doing more to prolong their pets' lives, from surgery to food, Vetere said. WHAT'S FOR DINNER . If food for pets sometimes sounds good enough to eat, it's because it is. San Diego-based Honest Kitchen and Vero Beach, Florida-based Caru Natural Dog Stews are two pet food brands considered human-grade by the U.S. Food and Drug Administration because their grub is made with ingredients palatable by people and produced in facilities meeting higher safety requirements. Americans spent the most on food for their pets last year, and much of it mirrored human trends, such as gluten-free, wheat-free, little sugar or reduced-calorie. The feast might come dry, wet, raw, baked, flaked, shredded, diced, sliced, frozen or freeze-dried. PET SALES DOWN . Sales of the animals themselves dropped from $2.23 billion in 2013 to $2.15 billion in 2014, which was expected because spending in the category has fallen slightly each of the past several years, Vetere said. There is likely no one reason, he said. But adoptions at shelters and rescues are strong, many cities banned the sale of dogs from puppy mills and the lifespans of dogs and cats have lengthened. INDUSTRY GROWTH . As pets have become more important parts of U.S. families, spending on them has exploded. There has been more than a threefold increase since the group's first survey was released in 1994, when people paid out $17 billion. Spending grew 4.2 percent, from $55.72 billion in 2013 to $58.04 billion last year, Vetere said. COMPARING SPENDING . People spent about five times more on their pets than they did on movies last year. The box office firm Rentrak estimated that ticket sales from 2014 totaled $10.4 billion, a 5.2 percent drop from 2013. But people spent far more on their homes than they did their pets, with expenditures from home improvements and repairs reaching $298 billion in 2013, the most recent data available.

8a0544b7be9e11675336dd9b220ab95042c9d502,"It is back to the drawing board for manager Chris Ramsey after embattled QPR fell to an uninspiring defeat at Crystal Palace. The west Londoners have just five points to show from their last 12 top-flight matches, putting their Premier League status at serious risk. Saturday's 3-1 defeat at Selhurst Park was the latest hammer blow, making it four straight defeats after Ramsey last month oversaw Rangers' first away win of the campaign. QPR boss Chris Ramsey believes that his side can still stay up despite their defeat at Crystal Palace . Former Manchester United winger Wilfired Zaha slid in at the back post to give Palace a first-half lead . James McArthur doubled the home side's lead five minutes before half-time against QPR .

The hashtag #FacesOfProstitution started trending on Twitter  with sex workers from Australia and across the world using social media to share positive stories from their industry. It comes after Mamamia published a blog post from Christian group Exodus Cry last week that claimed the 1990 film Pretty Woman  lured women into the sex industry by 'leading them to believe that prostitution was glamorous and romantic'. Scroll down for video . Sydney sex worker Tilly Lawless started the hashtag #FacesOfProstitution on social media at the weekend by posting this photo to share positive stories from the industry . The blog post suggested 75 per cent of female sex workers had been raped, 95 per cent were physically abused and 68 per cent suffered from post-traumatic stress disorder. It also questioned how many sex workers had been deceived by Pretty Woman, the iconic movie that starred Julia Roberts as a warm-hearted prostitute and Richard Gere as a lonely millionaire businessman who fall in love. The post said the movie, which has regained prominence around the 25th anniversary of its release last week, deceived women into leading lives of 'abuse, trauma and slavery'. Sydney sex worker Tilly Lawless took to social media at the weekend to hit back at the article and #FacesOfProstitution quickly gained momentum. Carmen Sandiego, a touring escort, was among those to hit back at a blog post that claimed the 1990 film Pretty Woman lured women into the sex industry . Christian Vega, a sex worker from Tasmania, shared support for the hashtag saying he looked nothing like Julia Roberts - referencing the character she played in Pretty Woman . Lucie Bee, who has been in the industry for five years, says she wasn't forced into the industry, but admitted some were . 'Mamamia published an article that says that Julia Roberts' 'toothy smile is not the true face of prostitution' because all sex workers are drug addled victims,' she wrote alongside a photo of herself. 'There is no singular story or person to represent the varied and complex experiences of all sex workers, but here is one face of prostitution amongst a myriad.' Jackie Parker, a sex worker from Griffith in NSW, posted a photo of herself with a volunteer badge on Twitter saying: 'They make me prostitute and volunteer for aged care! This madness has to stop! Save me! She told news.com.au she had worked as an escort for 14 years and hadn't met anyone who was forced into the industry. 'The peple who are doing it tough make up a small percentage — that is not the norm for sex work in Australia,' she said. 'If you look at the faces of the women on the Twitter hashtag, we're all smiling. Implying we are victims is condescending and makes us feel like we don't have a voice. It makes me feel like I'm not living the right stereotype and it's really harmful.' Jackie Parker, a sex worker from Griffith in NSW, posted a photo of herself with a volunteer badge on Twitter saying: 'They make me prostitute and volunteer for aged care! This madness has to stop! Save me! Jane Green described the message behind the blog post as 'hate speech' as she shared the #FacesOfProstitution hashtag . Lucie Bee, who has been in the industry for five years, says she wasn't forced into the industry, but admitted some were. 'I chose to get started and I chose to continue. I worked in an establishment initially, an erotic massage parlour in Canberra, followed by nude modelling, porn and then escorting,' she told Daily Mail Australia. 'It's probably weird for a lot of people to consider that there's a 'journey' that you can take in this industry, much the same as working your way through any industry or career, but I've had one.' 'There's a huge stigma against sex workers in Australia. Pop culture generally feeds them the image of the down trodden, broken woman in sex work, which I'm not saying isn't a situation for some, but it's certainly not the situation for all. 'The fact that #FacesOfProstitution is trending makes me so happy. It's this massive symbol of unity amongst the industry, sex workers are feeling like they have a chance to stand up and be represented.' Savannah Sly posted this photo of herself saying she was sitting in a coffee shop, but no one would guess she was a sex worker .

3955b69f70b293b75db563ba9a8fef0a1c41b9a5,"Businesses attacked Labour last night over plans to force companies to share profits with employees. Senior party figures are said to be considering a proposal to oblige all firms with more than 50 staff to set up a profit-sharing scheme. Workers would then be handed a regular cash sum based on their employers' financial position. Senior business leaders have lined up to predict that Ed Miliband is a potential 'catastrophe' for the country . Labour last night said the idea was not official policy, although a shadow minister said it was being considered at the top of the party. But senior business leaders warned the plan would encourage employers not to take on staff. It is the latest in a string of damaging clashes between Labour and business leaders – who have lined up to predict that Ed Miliband is a potential 'catastrophe' for the country. Glen Cooper, chief executive of Midlands bollard makers ATG Access, said: 'We need Britain's small companies to grow bigger, not be stifled by Labour's meddling. 'This idea will make companies stop taking on employees rather than grow. I am happy to run my own scheme to motivate my employees, but I don't want to be dictated to by Labour.' The Labour policy would mirror the situation in economically feeble France, where companies with more than 50 employees have extra obligations, such as the establishment of a workers' council. It has been reported that such burdens are costing 140,000 jobs, and President Francois Hollande wants to repeal them. Charlie Bradshaw, managing director of Matrix APA, a product design company with 60 staff, said: 'Forcing companies to share profits when they hit 50 employees, just as France seeks to repeal similar laws, will threaten jobs' Simon Walker, of the Institute Of Directors, said: 'We cannot believe that the Labour leader will take such an obviously counterproductive measure seriously. 'Employee profit sharing can work well for companies who choose it, but it has to be up to them. This idea would give companies with 49 employees a very strong incentive not to grow. 'The French government is actually attempting to reduce the bureaucracy that kicks in at 50 workers because they know it is damaging job creation.' Mr Thomas, chairman of the Co-op party, said the policy was being considered at the highest levels . Charlie Bradshaw, managing director of Matrix APA, a product design company with 60 staff, said: 'Forcing companies to share profits when they hit 50 employees, just as France seeks to repeal similar laws, will threaten jobs. 'Small companies should be run by the people who know their culture and staff best, not by central government.' There are around 36,000 companies with 50 or more employees in Britain, employing a total of 12.9million. It means the suggested legislation would therefore affect about 53 per cent of those employed in the UK. It is being championed by Gareth Thomas, a shadow minister and has been adopted by the affiliated Co-operative Party, represented in Parliament by 31 Labour MPs – including Ed Balls. Mr Thomas, chairman of the Co-op party, said the policy was being considered at the highest levels. He added: 'Hard work too often doesn't lead to higher wages for the working majority, but simply gets funnelled into greater rewards for those at the very top.' A Labour source insisted last night the idea was not party policy. Tory MP Julian Smith said: 'This is another policy that will kill off jobs. Every Labour government in history has left unemployment higher.' Mr Miliband has proposed a series of ideas which have infuriated business groups – including an energy price freeze and plans for more paternity leave. Bosses have also been riled by Labour's anti-business rhetoric.","Labour may make firms with 50 or more staff set up profit sharing scheme .

She was arrested on Wednesday and has been charged with statutory rape by an authority figure. According to Fox 13, Jackson is being held on $50,000 bond and has declined to comment. She is expected to appear in court on Thursday morning. Under Tennessee law, statutory rape by an authority figure states that the victim is between 14 and 18-years-old, the aggressor is at least four years older than the victim, and that they 'had, at the time of the offense, parental or custodial authority over the victim and used the authority to accomplish the sexual penetration. The charge means that should she be convicted, she would not be eligible for probation and forced to serve her full sentence. It is not known at this time why Jackson was living in the boy's home or if there is any relation between her and the boy's parents.","A 50-year-old woman has been charged after having sex with a boy, 14, while living in his family's home .

April Gilmour, 24 from Kilmarnock, had already eaten half of the breakfast snack when she noticed the thick short dark hairs. The furious mother-of-two said she felt 'sick to her stomach' after making the gruesome discovery and posted a picture of the hairy sausage and egg McMuffin on Facebook on Wednesday which has now been shared more than 600 times. Mrs Gilmour was disgusted when she discovered what appeared to be covered in beard trimmings in her McMuffin . Mrs Gilmour believes the hair came from a staff member at her local McDonald's on Armour Street in Kilmarnock, Scotland, after she claimed the manager ran a 'clean shaven' policy. She wrote on Facebook: 'This was my sausage and egg McMuffin from McDonald's in Kilmarnock this morning. 'I had eaten half of it and opened it up to put more sauce in and noticed it was full of hair shavings. Disgusting! 'The manager told me they operate a clean shave policy - well clearly some wee radge has shaved all over their uniform and it's fell into my breakfast.' April Gilmour (pictured) had already eaten half of the breakfast snack when she noticed the thick short dark hairs . The beautician added: 'It's obviously an accident but I feel sick to my stomach thinking about it.' An area manager for McDonald's in Kilmarnock confirmed April had been in touch with the Armour Street branch of the restaurant about her McMuffin. Mrs Gilmour and her husband Ross, 25, said the experience had put them off McDonalds food for life. 'It's cheap junk anyway, but this is even more reason not to buy it,' said Mr Gilmour. 'It's definitely put us off for life. April felt disgusted. 'She had just got it and had gone to sit and eat it in her car when she found the hairs. She told the manager who was apologetic but said he could clearly see the hair in it. 'April decided to post the picture of it thinking we could warn people.' The picture of the McMuffin sparked a host of comments on Facebook, with one of her friends, called Sammi Rankin, writing: 'Do you normally have beard for breakfast ? You've ate someone's facial hair.' Katie Glass wrote: 'Beware of the hairy burger and eggs - you could be next.' Fi Balloch wrote: 'Man shavings.' While Kerri Campbell added: 'Boak.

42029f8c8d74d9ab7db1d2ba5fed8be961ae77d0,"(CNN)A migrant worker whose life ended in Washington after police shot at him 17 times. A father of four killed by an officer during a traffic stop in Texas. A man killed during a robbery investigation in California. After three Mexican citizens were killed by police in the United States in the past month, Mexico's Foreign Ministry says the U.S. Justice Department should step in. ""Given that these incidents cannot be looked at in isolation, the Mexican government has called for the U.S. Department of Justice through its civil rights division to monitor the investigation of these three cases to assure that they're conducted with transparency and where appropriate, the proper criminal or civil responsibility is determined,"" Mexico's Foreign Ministry said on Monday. The Mexican government's statement comes amid a debate that has surged across the United States about whether police are using excessive force, particularly when they deal with minority groups. ""Adding to our consternation over the third case of a Mexican killed by an excessive use of force in less than one month, is our deep concern for the effect of the break in trust between the Hispanic community and the police forces that could result from these actions,"" the foreign ministry said. Investigators said they're still piecing together information on all three cases. No charges have been filed. Here's a look at what we know so far: . Protesters at a city council meeting in Grapevine, Texas, this week chanted a familiar refrain: ""Hands up! Don't shoot!"" For the demonstrators, the chant -- which started as a call to action after the police shooting death of Michael Brown in Ferguson, Missouri -- has become a rallying cry for another case. Police shot 31-year-old Rubén García Villalpando in the Dallas suburb of Euless, Texas, on February 20. Investigators say the case started when a burglar alarm sounded at a business. Villalpando's car, which was in the area, was followed by police in what authorities described as a high-speed chase. Eventually, Villalpando pulled over. Villalpando was unarmed, but in early reports about the shooting, police said an altercation erupted after he disobeyed an officer's commands during a traffic stop. The traffic stop was caught on camera, but police haven't released the dash cam video to the public. ""There will be more information released as the investigation continues. This additional information may shed more light on Mr. Villalpando's actions that night,"" police and city officials said. ""We look forward to the time that the community can review the dash cam video of this incident, which we believe will answer many questions and correct some misconceptions about this incident."" Villalpando's family said they've seen the video, and even though it doesn't show the officer or the shooting,  they said one thing is clear: Villalpando was unarmed and did nothing to threaten the officer who stopped him. Fernando Romero said it was jarring to hear what his brother-in-law said in the video as he gets out of the vehicle. ""My brother-in-law is out of the car with his hands up,"" Romero said, ""and the first thing he asks is, 'Are you going to kill me?'"" Marta Romero, Villalpando's wife, said her husband made a mistake when he didn't stop when the officer tried to pull him over. But she said he was trying to cooperate and turn himself in. ""He was painted like a criminal who was involved in a robbery and had assaulted an officer, and in the video you don't see any of those things,"" she said. ""You see the opposite, a man who is scared, who is simply trying to calm the situation, who sees that the police officer has a weapon in his hands."" Police say Ernesto Javier Canepa Díaz, 28, was killed February 27 after a shooting broke out during a robbery investigation. ""At this time we need the process to continue in order to know what happened,"" Santa Ana, California, Police Chief Carlos Rojas told CNN en Español. He declined to comment on the investigation, but said Canepa had been arrested in the past for various crimes, including narcotics possession, possessing stolen property, domestic violence and resisting police. When police came across his car last week, he was wanted for a series of robberies, Rojas said. ""He did not cooperate with the police and we know that a police officer shot various times at him and he died at the scene,"" Rojas said. And police, he said, found a replica of a gun inside the car. ""We do not know if this is the reason why the police officer used force. That will be investigated,"" Rojas said. Canepa's family said they don't believe police were justified in opening fire. ""Whatever it was, he did not deserve to die this way,"" said Mayte Canepa, Ernesto's sister. ""He did not deserve for them to shoot at him like they did."" The Orange County Register reported that at a press conference on Tuesday, Canepa's brother, Andres, described police as ""a gang with a badge."" The officer who shot Canepa has been suspended with pay until the investigation is finished, police said. A proud laborer from Mexico, Antonio Zambrano-Montes picked fruit in the orchards of Washington state, but when his most valuable tools -- his hands -- became injured last year, he fell into deep despair. He couldn't work or send money to family in Mexico, two routines that shaped his life. It was this misfortune that distressed Zambrano-Montes in the days before he and police in Pasco, Washington, clashed in February, in a confrontation that ended with officers firing 17 bullets, hitting Zambrano-Montes several times and killing him. He was unarmed but was accused of pelting police with rocks. Police have said that Zambrano-Montes, 35, was throwing rocks at cars and trucks when confronted by officers. He then allegedly stoned two officers, and police resorted to deadly force, authorities said. Officers had used a Taser on him, but it wasn't effective, police said. The shooting now haunts his family, due in no small measure to how the hail of police bullets was captured on videos and posted on YouTube by bystanders. Zambrano-Montes' family said his limited English left him unable to understand the officers' commands, shouted in English. His mother, Agapita Montes, said she didn't see her son throwing rocks in the videos. ""The only thing I can see is that he's running, he raises his hands and they still shoot him. Why? I ask myself. Why?"" Montes said. Erlinda Zambrano, an aunt of Zambrano-Montes, also found it very difficult to accept the police version of events, she said. ""We are living with profound pain from how he died, and it's something very bad and terrible,"" the aunt said. ""I look at the videos now and I cannot sleep because it's too hard."" CNN's Michael Martinez, Gustavo Valdes and Alina Machado contributed to this report.","In the past month, three Mexican nationals have been killed in U.S. police shootings .

The move could reduce the number of ‘red cards’ which land on doormats to tell householders a package has been returned to the delivery office. Postmen already attempt to deliver parcels to people’s neighbours if they are out. But the new service means they can now deliver to a specific friend who lives nearby, in the recipient’s absence. Residents can now nominate a neighbour to receive their parcels so they never miss a delivery, Royal Mail announced yesterday (file picture) It means people can choose a neighbour who they know well, or who is often in during the day, to sign for a parcel or receive a delivery which will not fit through the letter box. The price of first and second class stamps rose by a penny each yesterday. A first class stamp now costs 63p while second class is 54p – more than double what it was ten years ago. Sending a large letter has gone up by 2p to 95p for first class and by 1p to 74p for second class. Royal Mail, which was privatised in 2013, said it had ‘thought carefully about the impact on customers’ because of ‘recent tough economic conditions’. However critics fear the increase will hit small businesses which depend on the postal service. The price rise is 1.6 per cent for a first class stamp, and 1.9 per cent for second class. John Allan, of the Federation of Small Businesses, said: ‘If you’re a business that relies heavily on the postal service, increases in prices won’t be welcomed. ‘Businesses affected will have to decide whether to absorb it or pass it on to their customers.’ Royal Mail said the ‘Nominate a Neighbour’ scheme would be more convenient for householders and ‘improve first-time delivery’. Sue Whalley, of Royal Mail, said: ‘This new initiative is great news for our customers as it offers further choice and convenience if there is no one at home. ‘For our postmen and women it means that they are even more likely to deliver parcels and letters first time rather than having to take items back to the office. First-time delivery of parcels and signed-for items is high in Royal Mail and in the trial delivery offices this improved further.’ Since 2012 Royal Mail has left parcels with neighbours if the recipient is not in. But critics feared this meant valuable packages could be left with untrustworthy or unfamiliar neighbours. Now customers can nominate a preferred neighbour by visiting their local delivery office, filling out a short form and presenting proof of their identity. Postmen will try to deliver to this neighbour in the first instance, before trying other addresses nearby. It is unclear if using the nominate service, however, will mean that households are now responsible if their parcel then goes missing. Under the old system, when postmen knocked on several neighbours’ doors, Royal Mail was still responsible if the parcel later went astray. Special delivery items and international parcels requiring a signature are excluded from the scheme.","Postmen can now deliver to a specific friends who lives nearby to recipient .

During a press conference held at 11.15am Friday, Philadelphia Police Capt. Darrell Clark named the suspects in the fatal shooting of Officer Robert Wilson III as Ramone Williams, 26, and Carlton Hipps, 30, . Williams had two prior arrests, while Hipps had six arrests and had been out on parole since 2009 following a robbery conviction. The pair of suspects have been charged with murder and attempted murder. Partners in crime: Carlton Hipps (left), 30, and Ramone Williams (right), 26, have been charged with the murder of a police officer inside a Philadelphia video game store . Officer: Philadelphia Police Officer Robert Wilson III, 30 (photographed), died Thursday after being shot in the head during an attempted robbery at a video-game store on the city's north side . Wilson, 30, was in a north Philadelphia GameStop in full uniform buying a video game for his 8-year-old son for getting good grades when the two suspects entered and announced a robbery. Wilson immediately confronted the suspects, and the three exchanged gunfire, with the assailants firing rounds at close range on either side of the officer, Commissioner Charles Ramsey told reporters. Wilson was struck multiple times in his body but continued to fire until he was fatally shot in the head, Ramsey said. 'The officer was an out-and-out hero and a warrior,' Captain Clark told reporters Friday. 'He fought to the end.' Wilson's partner, Officer Stevenson, was outside of the store and exchanged fire with one of the assailants. The second assailant fled and attempted to blend in with the crowd but was caught at the scene. One was shot in the leg, Ramsey said, but it is unclear if the assailant was shot by Wilson or his partner. According to police, Williams confessed to the fatal robbery, telling investigators during questioning that he and his brother had thought the GameStop was going to be an easy target. Wilson was rushed to Temple University Hospital where he was pronounced dead at 6.25pm, NBC reports. Wilson was an eight-year veteran of the department, a husband, and a father of two boys, ages 1 and eight. His older son will celebrate his 9th birthday Monday. GameStop: Wilson was in full uniform inside a North Philadelphia GameStop (photographed) as part of his patrol duties when two armed men entered the store and announced a robbery . Struck: Wilson was struck multiple times but continued to fire until he was fatally shot in the head (here, Wilson's body is transported by ambulance to the Medical Examiner's Office) Procession: A procession was held for the officer Thursday as his body was transported by ambulance to the Medical Examiner's Office . Never Forgotten: Department officials posted on the Philadelphia Police Department's Facebook page writing that Wilson's sacrifice will 'never, ever, be forgotten' 'Take a moment and say a prayer for this family,' Ramsey said. 'And this 9-year-old boy who will now grow up without a father. A 1-year-old is going to grow up without a dad because of what happened today.' Authorities later found the suspect's weapons in the store: a .40-caliber and a 9mm. Another weapon, an AK-47, was recovered during a search warrant at one of the suspects' home, Ramsey said. In all, over 50 shots were fired during the gun battle inside the video game store. Police say both the suspects were repeat offenders and one was on parole at the time of the shooting. The suspect who was shot was taken to a local hospital but his condition has not been released, NBC reports. Wilson was a volunteer in the department's body-camera program but is was not immediately known if he was wearing one at the time of the shooting, Ramsey said. However, a surveillance camera in the store captured the incident. The video has been reviewed by homicide investigators. A procession was held for the officer Thursday as his body was transported by ambulance to the Medical Examiner's Office. At the news conference, Ramsey said he met Wilson and his partner when they took part in a recent pilot program in which officers wore body cameras. He described the father of two as a 'very, very brave, heroic individual.' 'People tend to lose sight of the dangers inherent in being a police officer,' Ramsey said. 'Sometimes they're seriously injured or even murdered as a result of trying to protect every single person in this city...He put his life on the line to make Philadelphia a better city and a safer city.' Volunteer: Wilson (left) was a volunteer in the department's body-camera program but is was not immediately known if he was wearing one at the time of the shooting .

Ings (centre) has been Burnley's star player as they try to stay in the Premier League this season . Ings scored for Burnley against United in his side's 3-1 defeat and impressed with his display . Born: England, July 23 1992 (age 22) 2006-2009: Bournemouth (youth) 2009-2011: Bournemouth (27 apps, 7 gls) 2010-2010: Dorchester Town (loan) (9, 4) 2011-NOW: Burnley (112, 36) 2013-NOW: England U21 (7, 4) Ings has been tracked by Real Sociedad and the former Bournemouth youth travelled to Spain to meet manager David Moyes three weeks ago. But Burnley would receive about £6million in compensation if Ings joined another club in England, while a move abroad would net the second-bottom  side just £300,000. It would cost £43m for United to make Radamel Falcao's season-long loan from Monaco permanent, and Ings is a cut-price option. The starlet was reluctant to leave Burnley in January but becomes a free agent after May. Manchester City contacted his representatives in February and want to sign Ings to boost their homegrown quota. The  champions bought Wilfried Bony from Swansea City for £25m, rising to £28m, in January but Juventus have shown interest in Stevan Jovetic, while Edin Dzeko could leave for Wolfsburg. The loss of Frank Lampard to New York City and possibly James Milner would leave Manuel Pellegrini short of home talent, and Ings could fill the gap. Louis van Gaal sent chief scout Jim Lawlor to watch Ings play against Liverpool at Anfield on Wednesday . The £5million compensation would be far cheaper than the £43m they would have to pay for Radamel Falcao . Falcao has not impressed enough at United since joining from Monaco on a season-long loan .","Louis van Gaal sent chief scout Jim Lawlor to watch Burnley's Danny Ings .

5afaf062f5ece639d266efbeaf9e1788069baba1,"Sanaa, Yemen (CNN)At any moment, Saudi troops could march through Yemen, heating up an already intense conflict that could have ramifications across the Middle East. On Monday, a Saudi-led coalition of nine countries continued airstrikes against Shiite Houthi rebels, who have captured key parts of Yemen and ousted that country's President, and who could spread Iran's influence in the region. And the notion of an Iranian proxy power in Yemen is unacceptable to many -- especially Iran's staunch rival Saudi Arabia. 'Tricky issues' remain in nuclear talks with Iran . ""I think the Saudis ... feel directly, physically threatened by what is happening,"" said Richard Haass, president of the Council on Foreign Relations. But if the coalition takes the fight to the ground in Yemen, the consequences could be severe. Houthis are battle-hardened guerrilla fighters and could cross into Saudi Arabia. They've already threatened suicide bomb attacks inside Saudi Arabia. And Yemen, already the home base to al Qaeda in the Arabian Peninsula, now teeters on the brink of becoming a failed state and an even more fertile breeding ground for extremism. Here's the latest on the crisis in Yemen and its impact around the world: . Saudi-led airstrikes targeted Houthi military posts and weapons depots in the capital city of Sanaa on Monday, two Houthi commanders told CNN. Yemen's Defense Ministry said a Saudi airstrike hit Al-Mazeraq refugee camp in Haradh, near the Saudi border, killing at least 40 internally displaced people and injuring 250. The group Medecins Sans Frontieres (Doctors Without Borders) tweeted that one of its teams had received ""30 wounded plus 15 dead bodies following airstrike on IDP camp today."" Previously, airstrikes hit Houthi militant groups, smashed their air defense guns and crumbled key infrastructure, a Saudi official has said. Egyptian warships fired on the road that runs from the Yemeni port town of Zinjibar into the key coastal city of Aden but did not fire on Aden directly, according to an official with Yemen's Southern Movement. The road is the eastern approach to Aden and is one of the three main roads into the city. The Egyptian naval barrage is intended to block the Houthi advance on Aden and push those fighters back, the source said. Egyptian warships had deployed to the Bab al-Mandab strait last Friday, according to media reports, intent on protecting that passage that is the only access from the Arabian Sea to Egypt's Suez Canal. The coalition's campaign has been dubbed Operation al-Hazm Storm. The Arabic term ""al-Hazm"" can be translated as ""determinant"" or ""decisive."" Saudi Arabia and Egypt have both talked about the possibility of putting boots on the ground. On Saturday, Yemeni Foreign Minister Riyadh Yaseen said he expected coalition troops to be in Yemen within days. Saudi leaders have said that if troops do go in, they won't leave until they have degraded the Houthis' ability to fight. The Houthis are apt guerrillas. A fight on the ground could prove bloody and lengthy. The conflict splits the region along religious lines. Operation Decisive Storm's largely Sunni coalition includes Saudi Arabia, the United Arab Emirates, Kuwait, Bahrain, Qatar, Jordan, Morocco, Egypt and Sudan. On Monday, Pakistan's government said Prime Minister Nawaz Sharif had chaired ""a high-level meeting"" of senior officials to review the situation in the Middle East. ""The meeting concluded that Pakistan remains firmly committed to supporting the sovereignty and territorial integrity of Saudi Arabia in accordance with the aspirations of the people of Pakistan,"" it said in a statement. ""It was emphasized that Pakistan stands committed to playing a meaningful role in arresting the deteriorating situation in the Middle East. In the same context, and to facilitate early resolution of the crisis and to promote peace and unity of the Muslim Ummah (community), the Prime Minister would be contacting the leadership of brotherly countries,"" the statement continued. The Shiite Houthis are allied with Iran, a majority Shiite nation. Saudi Arabia has accused Iran of boosting the Houthis' weaponry for their offensive. Iran has sharply denounced the Saudi-dominated intervention in Yemen. On Sunday, Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu accused Iran of trying to use the conflict in Yemen to ""take over the whole Middle East."" The United States has supported the coalition's efforts. While it is helping the Saudi-led team with logistics and locating targets, the U.S. is not participating in active battle. Dozens have died in the airstrikes, Houthi commanders said. The rebel commanders also said the coalition struck the Houthi-controlled Al Anad air base, which was used as the headquarters for U.S. counterterrorism operations before Houthi rebels took control of it. The Houthis claimed they shot down a Sudanese jet and captured the pilot on Saturday. They distributed photos of a pilot and wreckage to back up the claim. The Yemeni crisis erupted when Shiite Houthi rebels, who have long felt marginalized in the majority Sunni country, began seizing the capital and other parts of the country last fall. Houthis moved into Sanaa in September, sparking battles that killed hundreds of people. Yemeni President Abdu Rabu Mansour Hadi fled the capital over a month ago. In January, Houthis surrounded the presidential palace. Hadi resigned and was put under house arrest. He escaped in February and went to the coastal city of Aden, but declared he was still the country's leader. Last week, Hadi went to Sharm el-Sheikh, Egypt, to attend the Arab League summit, where he is rallying support for Operation Decisive Storm. Even from afar, Hadi had strong words for the Houthis: . ""You violated the sovereignty (of Yemen),"" he said, ""and you bear the responsibility for what happened and what is going to happen."" That Arab League summit produced a notable agreement: the Sharm el-Sheikh Declaration, which paves the way for a united Arab force that would be ready to fight insurgents if a member country came under attack. Egyptian President Abdel Fattah el-Sisi actually called for a joint Arab force last month to fight ISIS. But the agreement over the weekend carries extra significance amid the battle against Houthis in Yemen. Egypt: It's time for an Arab coalition against ISIS . The logistics and details of the joint Arab force have yet to be worked out. But the declaration also urges the Houthis to immediately withdraw from Yemen's government institutions and to surrender their arms to ""legitimate authorities."" Many U.N. representatives have had to flee the chaos. And Saudi naval special forces have rescued dozens of diplomats, a Saudi official said. The conflict in Yemen also led to the withdrawal of U.S. special forces earlier this month, seriously undermining counterterrorism efforts in a country that has been a stronghold for al Qaeda in the Arabian Peninsula. Haass, of the Council on Foreign Relations, said what's happening in Yemen could devolve into a long, protracted religious war. ""You have civil wars, you have proxy wars. You have regional wars all in one,"" he said. ""And these things have so many logs on the fire, to use the metaphor, that they ... burn and burn and burn for a long time."" Journalist Hakim Almasmari reported from Sanaa; CNN's Holly Yan reported and wrote from Atlanta. CNN's Fareed Zakaria, Anas Hamdan, Tim Lister and Ian Lee contributed to this report.","Saudi airstrikes kill 40 at refugee camp, Yemen's Defense Ministry says .

In contrast, budget hotel Travelodge offers customers a 30-minute grace period then asks for £3 for a day of internet – whereas rival Premier Inn offers customers free internet and an upgraded service for just £5. Many luxury hotels are charging for a good wi-fi connection, which many coffee shops and pubs offer for free . The Dorchester in London charges guests £19.50 a day for premium wi-fi, but it's free in one of their top suites . A Sunday Times survey of 50 hotels, including the most expensive and those with budget room rates, revealed a third have extra charges for wi-fi. Almost all hotels that charge for internet use allows guests free wi-fi in communal areas, but the service usually quite slow. The Dorchester in London's Mayfair describes itself as the 'favourite choice of celebrities, world leaders, royalty and high society'. But even they would have to pay £19.50 per day for premium wi-fi – although it's a complimentary perk if staying in one of their elite suites, which cost up to £3,700 a night. The Langham in London, where suites cost up to £24,000-a-night, high-speed wi-fi will cost you an extra £15 . At the Langham in London, the suites cost up to an eye-watering £24,000 a night, high-speed wi-fi costs guests £15.

The Sheraton Grand Hotel in Edinburgh's basic wi-fi is free, but charges £12.95 for a premium service. The Savoy and Mandarin Oriental hotels in Hyde Park, London, offer customers free premium wi-fi for a day, but only if you sign up as a member. Otherwise, it's £15 and the Mandarin Oriental and £9.95 at The Savoy. The Savoy and Mandarin Oriental (pictured) hotels in London offer customers free premium wi-fi if they sign up as members .

She said: 'We provide free access to a connection speed of 512kb which enables our guests to stay connected through email, social media, using apps, and browsing the internet. 'To meet the requirements of guests who wish to download extremely large files or stream video content, we bring large capacity fibre internet into the property to offer an optional premium service with extremely fast upload and download speeds which is charged at £19.50. 'This charge is included in our top suite rates.' She added hotel guests also have access to a team of eButlers, who are available to assist with any IT requirements. In comparison, budget chain Premier Inn offers customers free internet and an upgraded service for just £5 . Jackie Grech, of the British Hospitality Association, told the Sunday Times the reason for the extra charges is because hotels realise that 'wi-fi is as important as hot water' for guests. She explained premium wi-fi will continue to cost guests more because the investment costs for delivering the service is greater. The Dorchester, Premier Inn and the Langhan told the newspaper they provided a high-quality service and were committed to ensuring guest satisfaction. Mandarin Oriental Hotel Group and Hilton Worldwide cited their loyalty programmes, which offer free connection to guests who sign up to become members.

1eaf3e4de971f22766fb65954e461aaf6f9707c2,"Kevin Pietersen has agreed a release from his Indian Premier League contract as he seeks a new deal with Surrey to try to reignite his hopes of an England recall. Pietersen was axed by England in February 2014 after their whitewash in Australia, but is hoping for a still unlikely international return in time for this summer's Ashes rematch. He confirmed, on his website kevinpietersen.com that he has taken another key step to that end by agreeing a release from the majority of his contract with the Sunrisers Hyderabad. Kevin Pietersen's plans to return to county cricket with Surrey have moved a significant step closer . Pietersen said: 'I'm hugely grateful for all the support and understanding I've received from everyone at the Sunrisers and the IPL. 'My focus is now very much on the upcoming season in England, and I'm absolutely determined to score as many runs as possible.' Surrey de-registered Pietersen at the end of last season but have nonetheless long been front-runners to re-sign him. His availability for all formats, as soon as possible, has appeared a starting point for that to happen - and Pietersen's presence in early season, rather than spending six weeks at the IPL, is therefore a key development. Pietersen plays a shot on the second day of the Ashes series between England and Australia last year . New England and Wales Cricket Board chairman Colin Graves this month revived the record-breaking 34-year-old batsman's hopes of a return to the fold, contrary to the public remarks by anyone else associated with the governing body. But a pre-requisite from Graves was that Pietersen must first of all find a way back into county cricket - and then, of course, start scoring runs again. Pietersen may still be recalled by the Sunrisers for just a one-week period, should they qualify for the IPL knockout stages between May 19 and May 24. That, however, ought not to be an insurmountable problem for any county interested in securing his services. Pietersen bats for Melbourne Stars during the Big Bash League semi-final match against the Perth Scorchers . He added: 'I've never made any secret of my overwhelming desire to once again represent England, and I'm going to do everything in my power to earn a recall to the international set-up. 'To once again put on that England shirt would be a privilege and an honour, but now I have to focus on performing domestically and give myself the best possible chance of meriting selection.' A statement on his website spelled out Pietersen's next move - without specifying Surrey as his immediate destination - and that he has his heart set on an England return in time for the start of the Ashes in July. Pietersen was involved in a high-profile dispute with England coach Peter Moores back in 2009 . It read: 'The four-time Ashes winner, who is also England's highest ever runscorer in all formats, will ... join a domestic county with the aim of earning a place in the England squad for the upcoming Ashes series.' Pietersen quickly made it clear at the start of this month that he was delighted to take Graves at his word, that the slate will be wiped clean for all under his tenure, and he has since confirmed he has already spoken to the incoming chairman on the telephone. The controversial South Africa-born batsman has received little encouragement yet from other quarters. Former England star Pietersen previously rubbished claims suggesting his best days are behind him . ECB managing director Paul Downton pinpointed Pietersen's 'disengagement' with his team-mates during his last Test match to date - the defeat in Sydney which consigned England to their 5-0 2013/14 Ashes whitewash. Downton has not shifted from that in the intervening months. When England announced their squad last week, to travel under Alastair Cook and without Pietersen for three Tests in the West Indies, national selector James Whitaker repeated many times that he is simply 'not part of our plans'. Pietersen, however, has said he will 'do anything' to play for England again.","Kevin Pietersen agrees release from his Indian Premier League contract .

d3b51976071ae2ac34088947a476fda398d1dd1f,"(CNN)Two former neighbors of Justin Bieber have filed a lawsuit against the pop star, claiming he and his bodyguards repeatedly harassed them and their family, vandalized their house with eggs and threatened them with anti-Semitic remarks. In the lawsuit Jeffrey and Suzanne Schwartz say Bieber hosted frequent loud parties and spat in Jeffrey Schwartz' face after he complained about the pop star driving his Ferrari at dangerous speeds down the street of their gated community in Calabasas, California. The suit, filed Thursday in Los Angeles Superior Court, also alleges Bieber's bodyguards dismissed Jeffrey Schwartz's complaints by taunting him repeatedly with ""what are you going to do about it, Jew boy?"" The suit seeks unspecified damages and a jury trial. Representatives for Bieber did not immediately respond to requests for comment Thursday afternoon. The lawsuit comes after Bieber, 21, pleaded guilty last July to a misdemeanor vandalism charge stemming from a January 9, 2014 incident in which the Schwartzes' house was pelted with dozens of eggs. Bieber agreed to pay $80,900 in restitution for damages to the house and was placed on two years' probation. It's the latest chapter in a string of legal troubles for the polarizing former teen idol, who in recent years has been convicted of careless driving and resisting arrest and is facing dangerous driving and assault charges after his ATV collided with a minivan last August in Canada. Thursday's lawsuit alleges a nine-month pattern of ""offensive"" behavior by Bieber and members of his entourage from March 2013 to January 2014. The Schwartzes, who lived next door to Bieber, claim the harassment escalated after a March 27, 2013 episode in which Bieber spat in Jeffrey Schwartz' face and threatened to ""f---ing kill"" him. The following year, after the egging episode made headlines, the Schwartzes say they and their children were subject to ""constant harassment"" by Bieber's entourage, fans and the media. The couple are seeking damages on the grounds of assault and battery and infliction of emotional distress. Bieber sold the Calabasas house for $7. 2 million last year to Khloe Kardashian and has since been renting a $60,000-a-month home in Beverly Hills, according to Forbes.","Two former neighbors of Justin Bieber file lawsuit against the pop star .

1dacd42143c3ef6e64ff85e0f1c1ff1761985a1b,"Port Vila, Vanuatu (CNN)Tropical Cyclone Pam had already been battering Vanuatu's capital for hours when the River Prima suddenly flooded its banks. A wall of water and mud surged through Sam Upan's house, toppling the walls of the neighboring church where he serves as a deacon. It was midnight on Friday, and he had no choice but to wade out into the gale force wind and darkness. ""The water was up to my waist!"" he says. Upan eventually made it to higher ground, taking shelter on a parked van.  Fortunately, he had sent his family away before the storm to a shelter in the center of the capital, Port Vila. But on Monday, three days after the storm struck, Upan and his daughters sit in the debris strewn rubble of their home. On Sunday, he built a temporary shack for them to sleep under.  A bundle of bananas donated by a friend lies nearby in the mud. It's the only food the family has to eat. Nearby, Upan's daughter Elsie slowly scrubs mud out of a shirt. Other families all across this tropical town are facing similar difficulties in the aftermath of the storm. To many Westerners, Vanuatu is a holiday destination boasting crystal blue waters and luxury yachts. But it's also one of the poorest nations in the Pacific, and many of its 260,000 inhabitants live in flimsy houses built of thatch or metal sheets. Those vulnerable homes were dealt a fearsome blow over the weekend by Cyclone Pam, one of the strongest storms ever to make landfall. The aid group Oxfam is warning that the cyclone may have caused ""one of the worst disasters ever seen in the Pacific."" The storm rampaged across Vanuatu's sprawling archipelago of more than 80 islands on Friday and Saturday, wielding 155 mph (250 kph) winds. About 65 islands in the archipelago are inhabited. The full extent of the devastation remained unclear Monday. With communication lines to many of the outer islands cut, it could take days or even weeks to emerge. Eleven people have so far been confirmed dead, according to Vanuatu authorities said. But the U.N. Office for the Coordination of Humanitarian Affairs said the toll was expected to rise. The agency said 3,300 people were taking shelter in 37 evacuation centers. How to help Vanuatu residents . Vanuatu President Baldwin Lonsdale told CNN the destruction was the worst his country had ever experienced, describing the storm as ""a monster."" He said it would take the developing nation ""a couple of years"" to get back to where it was before Pam struck. In the capital, Port Vila, residents were still reeling from the storm's impact. Thousands of people have been left homeless and many who rely on subsistence farming to get by have seen their main source of food wiped out. Most people live on root crops, said Jonathan Napat, a ranking natural disaster official. ""What the people depend on entirely is just wiped out."" He was overwhelmed by the dimension of the food loss. ""Just unbearable. Just too much to contain,"" he said. A CNN team that arrived in the capital Monday saw more than 100 people taking refuge in church. In one valley, trees were snapped in two or stripped of leaves. Many residents said it was the worst storm that they can remember. And that's in a Pacific nation that's regularly hit by cyclones. Officials say Cyclone Pam destroyed or badly damaged 90% of the houses in Port Vila, as well as flooding parts of the hospital and trashing schools and churches. There were some small signs of progress around the capital. A lack of electricity and running water hasn't stopped residents from starting the hard work of clearing away fallen trees and branches, as well as the corrugated metal roofing that Pam ripped off thousands of buildings. The sound of chainsaws and handsaws can be heard throughout the shell-shocked community. The main airport is back in business, allowing military aircraft from Australia and New Zealand to bring in aid workers and supplies. The first commercial flight since the storm landed Monday. But the big unknown remains the scale of the destruction the huge storm wrought on the outer islands to the north and south of the capital. ""It's certainly deeply concerning because those islands down there were incredibly hard hit,"" said Tom Perry, a spokesman for the aid organization CARE International. Many people now lack the basics of life: clean water, food and shelter. ""Homes have been lost, crops are destroyed. The damage is enormous, and people need our help,"" said Aurelia Balpe, head of the Red Cross in the Pacific. ""Yet it will still take some time before we really understand the full extent of the damage."" Some 60,000 children are in need of assistance, UNICEF reported Sunday. Vanuatu has officially declared a state of emergency, opening the door for other countries to help. The country's remote location adds to the challenges facing the international response. Port Vila is more than 1,770 kilometers (1,100 miles) northeast of Brisbane on Australia's east coast, and some 2,200 kilometers north of Auckland, the closest city in New Zealand. CNN's Ivan Watson reported from Port Vila, and Jethro Mullen reported and wrote from Hong Kong.

903fda893d6ddbe4e8eaaa4d3a610b4168f3c287,"(CNN)The emissions sticker on David Kassick's car was expired. That's what first caught the attention of Lisa Mearkle, a police officer in Hummelstown Borough, Pennsylvania, who ordered Kassick, 59, to pull over on February 2. Instead, Kassick fled. Moments later, he lay dead on the ground in a yard near a relative's home. On Tuesday, Mearkle was arrested on a homicide charge following a state police investigation into the shooting. Mearkle's attorney, who described the use of deadly force in the case as justified, said he is girding his client for national scrutiny as the case finds itself on a growing list of officer-involved shootings. The final moments leading to Kassick's death were captured on video which Dauphin County District Attorney Ed Marsico Jr. said was critical in bringing the homicide charges. It was around 4 p.m. on February 2 when the 15-year police veteran first attempted to pull Kassick over, according to the charging documents. Instead of pulling over, Kassick took off and Mearkle gave chase, flipping on her lights and sirens. Less than a mile away, Kassick pulled into the driveway of a relative he'd been staying with and ran off on foot into the backyard, with Mearkle following close behind. As they ran through the yards behind Grandview Drive, the charging documents said, Mearkle fired her stun gun, automatically engaging a built-in audio and visual recording device. Marsico described the video: . ""She's running, she's tasing him, he falls to the ground. He's sort of writhing around on the ground a little bit,"" Marsico said. Standing several feet behind his prone body, Mearkle shouts for Kassick to show his hands. Despite the commands, Marsico said there were multiple points in the videos where Kassick is seen reaching beneath himself, his hands obscured to Mearkle. Holding the Taser in her left hand, court documents said, Mearkle drew her gun in her right hand and, while continuing to shout ""show me your hands,"" fired twice into Kassick's back. Kassick was pronounced dead at the scene. He was unarmed. Marsico said the video was critical in determining the first criminal charges brought against a police officer in a shooting like this in his 15 years as district attorney. ""He was face down on the ground, no weapon had been displayed. He didn't approach her, he didn't come toward her, he didn't verbally threaten her in any way,"" Marsico said of Kassick. ""It's our position that her use of deadly force was not necessary."" CNN has filed a Freedom of Information Act request to obtain the video, which it has not independently viewed. Mearkle later told investigators she thought Kassick had been reaching into his jacket for a gun, according to court documents. ""What was she supposed to do?"" Mearkle's attorney, Brian Perry said. ""She felt that this was the only option that she had."" ""Keep in mind she had tased this individual four times and was screaming commands to him and he kept reaching under,"" Perry said. Mearkle was placed on electronic monitoring on Tuesday after posting $250,000 bail. ""This was an extremely difficult case for all involved but in the end, we are servants of Justice and must now allow the judicial process to conduct a fair and impartial review of the allegations that have been presented,"" the Borough of Hummelstown said in a statement. Hummelstown Borough announced on Wednesday that Mearkle had been suspended from the Police Department without pay.","Police Officer Lisa Mearkle faces homicide charge for shooting an unarmed man .

The shooter may have unsuccessfully asked Darrell Shriver, 68, for a job before killing him, his son Carey Shriver, 46, and Carey's wife, Valirea, 44, according to the elder victim's cousin John, 72. Nine people are dead in the tiny rural community - including Aldridge, who turned the gun on himself after the shooting spree that followed the death of his 74-year-old mother Alice, who had been ill. Scroll down for video . Darrell Shriver, 68, of Tyrone, Missouri was shot in a Thursday night rampage along with his son Carey, (back center) 46, and Carey's wife Valirea, (right) 44. Above, the couple takes a vacation with their son and daughter . The shooter had asked Darrell Shriver, (right) 68, for a job but didn't get it, according to resident John Shriver, 72. Above, the victim and his wife Martha, (left) 67, who was wounded but expected to survive . Joe Alridge, 36, is suspected of killing Garold Dee Aldridge, 52, his wife Julie Ann Aldridge, 47, Harold Wayne Aldridge, 50, and his wife Janell Arlisa Aldridge, 48, as well as the Shrivers . Aldridge, who took his own life in his pickup truck on Friday morning, was described as a recluse by those in the town . It was known in the town that Aldridge's family and the Shrivers had been feuding for years, a resident of nearby Summersville told Daily Mail Online. The Shrivers were described as a hard-working clan that owned businesses including construction, cabinet making and cattle farming projects since 1969. Darrell Shriver's wife Martha, 67, was wounded and hospitalized with serious but stable injuries. She is expected to survive. 'Everybody is kind of just dazed, I'd guess you'd say,' John Shriver said. The elder Shriver discovered the bodies of Carey and Valirea after getting a call to check on them from Martha around 10.30pm but couldn't immediately find their 13-year-old child, according to the Kansas City Star. The boy, who hadn't woken up, was later found in his bed and taken in by his older, college-aged sister . He said that Aldridge 'didn't have much to do with people' and 'kind of stayed to himself'. The shooter is thought to have killed his cousin Garold Dee Aldridge, (center left) 52, and his wife Julie Ann Aldridge, (right) 47 . The motive for the gunman killing his cousin Harold Wayne Aldridge, 50, and his wife Janell Arlisa Aldridge, 48, is unknown . The Shrivers were described as a hardworking family that owned several businesses. Above, Carey and Valirea with their daughter . Martha Shriver (right) called John Shriver, 72, to check up on her son Carey before she and husband Darrell (left) were shot . Authorities identified the four other victims as Garold Dee Aldridge, 52, his wife Julie Ann Aldridge, 47, Harold Wayne Aldridge, 50, and his wife Janell Arlisa Aldridge, 48. The shooter was a cousin to the male victims Garold and Harold. John Shriver was unsure about why the killer would target his own family members, according to the Associated Press. His uncle Doyle Lay, 70, of Tyrone, said that tension between the shooter and his cousins 'had been brewing like this for a year, year and a half,' according to Arkansas Online. The alarm was first raised around 10.15pm by a 15-year-old girl wearing nothing but a nightgown who ran barefoot to her neighbor's house through the snow when her parents Garold Aldridge, 52, and Julie Aldridge, 47, were shot. 'She said she seen a man in her dad's bedroom, talking to him in a normal voice. Then she said she heard gunshots and screaming,' an unidentified neighbor said. 'She was barefoot, in a nightgown with no sleeves at all and her legs were all scratched up from briars, he told the Springfield News Leader. The shooter had no trouble getting into his neighbor's homes. Armed with a .45-caliber handgun, Aldridge shot his seven victims before killing himself in his pickup truck in the middle of a highway on the outskirts of Summersville, Missouri, to the east of Texas County. The car was still running. He did not leave a note. Around town, Aldridge was described as a recluse, and it was unclear what, if anything, he did for a living. Vernetta Lucille Swartz, 76, Joseph Aldridge's aunt, now lives California and said was grief-stricken. 'Two of my nephews and wives were shot, and I guess another nephew was the shooter,' she said. The shooter was found dead in his pickup truck in the middle of the highway after shooting seven people dead in rural Missouri. He was described as a recluse by those in town who knew of him . A 15-year-old girl ran to her neighbor's house after hearing her parents shot on a night that would ultimately claim nine lives (pictured) Police first heard of the incident after the young girl contacted police at around  10:15pm on Thursday evening . John Shriver is a relative of the Shriver victims, two of whom he found dead on the floor of their bedroom after being called by Martha Shriver . A neighbor told Daily Mail Online that everyone in the small towns of Tyrone and Summersville is aware of each other, and that Aldridge 'probably killed 10 per cent of the town's population last night'. Tyrone is estimated to have around 50 residents. All victims lived within a three mile radius of each other. Alice L. Aldridge, 74, the suspect's mother, 'died of natural causes' on the couch and is thought to have been dead for more than 24 hours before being found Thursday night. The woman, who Aldridge lived with, had a history of breast and lung cancer. Police discovered her while looking for her son. Her death may have sparked the suspect to go on his rampage, Texas County Coroner Tom Whittaker told the St Louis Post-Dispatch. Joseph Aldridge has a previous criminal history that includes being sentenced to 21 months in federal prison for possessing a handgun while being a marijuana user. He was released in 2010. Troopers began an investigation in the area following the shootings. A resident reported that authorities were knocking on doors at 3.45am on Friday. The state-wide Missouri State Highway Patrol is assisting the small town in the investigation. Authorities did not release a suspected motive for the killings and are not looking for any other suspects. Sheriff James Sigman (pictured) has said that the victims all lived within three miles of each other in the small town . 'This is a bucolic area, one of the reasons people move here is to avoid these kind of incidents' the superintendent of nearby Houston's school district said . Staff of the Houston's school district were told to arrive early for counseling Friday morning, according to the Houston Herald. Superintendent Scott Dill said that residents of the close-knit community are in a 'state of shock' and he has been trying to help kids come to grips with the situation. Children related to victims were not in school on Friday. 'This is a bucolic area, one of the reasons people move here is to avoid these kind of incidents,' he told Daily Mail Online. Texas County, Missouri is an Ozark region of about 25,000 people located east of college town Springfield and south of Army base Fort Leonard Wood. Tyrone is located in the southern portion of the county, south of Houston, the county seat, which has about 2,000 residents. Missouri Governor Jay Nixon said that the shootings were 'a horrific tragedy, and our hearts go out to the victims of these senseless acts and their families.' Department of Mental Health in the state have also made contact with local authorities to provide crisis intervention services and counseling. Mr Whittaker said that the county averages about one homicide a year, many years having none. The Aldridges will be buried on Thursday at First General Baptist Church in nearby Willow Springs. An online fundraising page for their family had raised more than $8,000 as of Sunday morning. Many residents of Texas County have expressed their condolences for the victims' families by changing their profile pictures to a man leaning over in prayer.

2a5548b4af23a9cbc61a56ffe60f9c64272fa02c,"David Cameron has pledged to offer MPs a vote on repealing the fox hunting ban if he wins the election and declared that he has the ‘countryside in my blood’. In an article for the Countryside Alliance magazine the Prime Minister makes a direct pitch to rural voters, insisting he understands their concerns and is proud of the country’s ‘rural identity’. He also points to his own ‘rural heritage’ and writes of feeling ‘most at home’ in the countryside, enjoying country walks and bike rides with his family and feeding the animals ‘at the next door farm’. The Prime Minister - at a hat factory in his Witney constituency today - has made a direct pitch to rural voters, insisting he understands their concerns and is proud of the country’s ‘rural identity’ And he says he makes political decisions ‘while tending my muddy veg patch.’ Mr Cameron says there is a ‘rural way of life which a born and bred Londoner might struggle to understand’ and spells out his personal opposition to the hunting ban. ‘I have always been a strong supporter of country sports. It is my firm belief that people should have the freedom to hunt, so I share the frustration that many people feel about the Hunting Act and the way it was brought in by the last government.’ ‘The Hunting Act has done nothing for animal welfare. A Conservative government will give Parliament the opportunity to repeal the Hunting Act on a free vote, with a government bill in government time.’ The pledge mirrors that made in the last Tory manifesto in 2010. Early last year, Mr Cameron admitted he had been forced to abandon any attempt to relax the law on hunting with dogs. The Lib Dems opposed the change as did a small number of Tory MPs known as ‘Blue Foxes’. Ministers concluded that any vote would likely to fail in the Commons and so set back the cause. Hunting foxes and other wild mammals with dogs in England and Wales was banned by Labour in 2004. In the article, Mr Cameron says he feels most at home in the countryside having been brought up in the village of Peasemore in Berkshire. He says he feels a ‘noticeable emotional shift’ when he arrives in his West Oxfordshire constituency on Friday after a week in London. David Cameron has pledged to offer MPs a vote on repealing the fox hunting ban if he wins the election and declared that he has the ‘countryside in my blood’ ‘We spend a lot of time outdoors as a family: walking, running, gardening, cycling and riding. We all help feed the animals at the next door farm and eagerly anticipate lambing time each year. Decisions get mulled over while tending my muddy veg patch.’ And he writes of his family’s ‘annual pilgrimage’ to North Cornwall ‘a place I’ve been going to even since I was a child’. ‘It feels only right that Truro hospital was where our youngest daughter, Florence, was born, cementing Cornwall in our family history.’ ‘Walking the coastal paths, fishing off the Doom Bar at low tide, or having a barbecue at Daymer Bay, looking across the estuary towards Padstow: this is the stuff that memories are made of.’ The Tories are hopeful of picking up several seats in the South West of England from the Lib Dems. Shadow environment secretary Maria Eagle said: ‘With Britain facing a cost-of-living crisis because of his failing plan, David Cameron’s continued focus on fox hunting shows how out of touch he is. ‘The Tories should get over their narrow obsession with fox hunting and accept that Labour’s ban is widely supported.’ Tim Bonner, director of campaigns for the Countryside Alliance, said: ‘The Hunting Act has failed and there is a clear need to revisit it, so we welcome David Cameron's pledge of a free vote on its repeal.’ Joe Duckworth, chief executive of the League Against Cruel Sports said: ‘The Hunting Act is a testimony to the fact that we are a nation of animal lovers and we have an international reputation for our hatred of cruelty in the name of sport.’","PM said he had the 'countryside in my blood' in love letter to rural voters .

225c9a1fe7fd8bc90d30d9b384dcf68f5f103a7c,"His father was one of Italy's most notorious fugitives and dubbed 'The Tractor' on account of all the people he had mown down. But now, an American travel company has sparked outrage by recruiting the son of former mafia boss Bernardo Provenzano to give talks about his father's criminal life. Angelo Provenzano, 39, is now earning a living from talking to holidaymakers in Palermo about his childhood on the run after being signed up with the Boston-based Overseas Adventure Travel. Angelo, the son of mafia boss Bernardo Provenzano, is earning a living discussing his father's life to tourists . The notorious 'boss of bosses' was eventually captured after being caught in a farmhouse in April 2006 . A poster from 2005, a year before he was caught - Bernardo spent 43 years on the run before he was caught . His father, now, 82, is serving a life sentence for mafia crimes, including his involvement in the murders of the magistrates Giovanni Falcone and Paolo Borsellino in 1992. He spent 43 years on the run before being arrested in 2006 near his birthplace of Corleone, the name immortalised in The Godfather Hollywood movies based on Mario Puzo's books. He is said to have carried out 40 murders himself and ordered the deaths of at least 120 others in a career spanning more than 60 years after he joined the mob as a teenager. When the then chief Totto Riina was captured in 1993, Provenzano eventually became the 'capo di tutti capi' ('boss of bosses') of the 'Cosa Nostra'. Overseas Adventure Tour offer on their website 'an enlightening discussion about the Sicilian Mafia' But furious campaigners have denounced the move by the travel company, describing it as a story that 'still drips with blood'. Dino Paternostro, an anti-mafia campaigner from the Provenzanos' home town of Corleone, told the Times: 'I don't know what Angelo Provenzano tells the tourists, but I'm sure he doesn't tell them of the unspeakable acts of violence committed by Cosa Nostra and by a ferocious boss like his father. 'His performances may be building up negative heroes, who dramatically reduce the perception of the dangerousness of the mafia phenomenon.' Maria Falcone, the sister of the murdered anti-mafia judge Giovanni Falcone, said: 'It's true that the sins of the fathers should not fall on the sons, but it's not right to exploit the mafia, a story that still drips with blood.' A group called Addiopizzo, set up to provide support for people in Sicily forced to pay protection money, has been left outraged by the revelations. Dario Riccobono, from the organisation, told the Guardian: 'He's the son of the most famous mafia boss in Sicily, the director of the worst period of slaughter in the Italian mafia. 'It's clear that a person can't pay for their father, no one's asking for him to go to prison, but if he wants a normal life he should act in a certain way.' The mafia boss, pictured in 1963, when an arrest warrant was issued against him and (right) in 2006 after he was finally captured . The brother of Giuseppe Impastato, also known as Peppino, was a political activist who opposed the Mafia, which ordered his murder in 1978 - campaign groups have condemned the move by the travel agent . The talks take place at the Hotel Opera Plaza, in Palermo (pictured) and take place on the third day of the 15-day trip to Sicily offered by Overseas Adventure Travel . Bernardo Provenzano was born on January 31 1933 in Corleone, a Sicilian town synonymous with mafia activity (and which gave its name to the fictional family in the Godfather films). He is said to have joined the mafia in his late teens, after the Second World War. In 1963, as he rose up the ranks, Provenzano went on the run when an arrest warrant was issued against him for the murder of one of his rival's (Michele Navarra) men. Over the next five years, Provenzano helped his ally Luciano Leggio hunt down and kill many of Navarra's surviving supporters. In 1974, Leggio went to prison, leaving Toto Riina in charge with Provenzano his right-hand man. Riina was captured in 1993 and sentenced to life in prison. Provenzano took the helm. During his time as a fugitive, he corresponded with his family via 'pizzini' - small pieces of paper - instead of taking the risk of meeting them in person. Provenzano was convicted in absentia of a string of murders, including the 1992 killings of two judges, Giovanni Falcone and Paolo Borsellino, for which he was sentenced to life in jail. He was finally captured on April 11, 2006 in a Sicilian farmhouse in Corleone at the age of 73. Angelo, Bernardo's eldest son, defended his new job for the travel company. Speaking to Italin media, he described the matter as a 'personal affair' and asked: 'Do I have the right to a normal life or not?' He told La Repubblica newspaper: 'For me, it's only a matter of an important job opportunity in a sector, tourism, in which I have always thought there's potential.' He added: 'Meeting people from another culture, who are free of prejudice, is a very stimulating adventure for me.' Angelo, who spent the first 16 years of his life living in hiding, said people in Sicily and elsewhere were prejudiced against his family. He has previously described his life as being similar to a 'Big Brother contestant'. 'We have lived, and continue to live, as if we were Big Brother contestants. We have been actors in the biggest reality show on Cosa Nostra. 'I always try to make myself known by my Christian name, and not by my surname. I always introduce myself as Angelo and only if it is necessary do I add the rest.' Discussing his upbringing, he said: 'I was born and brought up in captivity'. In 1992, Angelo, his younger brother Francesco, now 32, and their mother Saveria Benedetta Palazzolo returned to their home town, Corleone, when 'my growing-up began', he said. He acknowledged he had found it 'difficult' to integrate with society and his family were closely watched. 'They monitored every setting, every space - the living room, the car, the bathroom, the windows. Whether they still monitor us, I don't know. We certainly behave as if we were [under surveillance].' According to reports, Angelo gave a talk to about 15 tourists charting his childhood on the run with his father. On a description of the third day of its $2995 (£2017) 15-day Sicily trip, the tour company invites the group to 'gather for an enlightening discussion about the Sicilian Mafia (also known as Cosa Nostra) with one of the sons of a former Mafia boss.' Salvo Cascino, from Overseas Adventure Travel, told the Daily Telegraph: 'Our guests, who are all over 60, want to truly get to know the country they're visiting. 'We also help them to meet fisherman in Portopalo and immigrants that have newly arrived in Sicily. There is also this mafia tour. We help them to understand Italy's South and all its problems.' Another tour guide said: 'If he is not allowed to work, how can Provenzano support himself honestly?'","Angelo Provenzano, 39, now earning a living from talking to holidaymakers .

Meni Naftali is suing the Israeli Prime Minister's office over allegations he was subjected to abusive language during his 20 months on the job. In the witness box yesterday Naftali - who is seeking around $250,000 (£167,000) in damages - claimed Sara Netanyahu drank large amounts of alcohol. Mrs Netanyahu vehemently denies the claim. Sara Netanyahu (right), wife of Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu (left), drank excessive amounts of alcohol including three bottles of champagne a day, a former caretaker claimed in court. Mrs Netanyahu denies the claims . The lawsuit, which was filed to the Jerusalem district labour court in Israel, states Naftali worked long hours and received 'unrestrained tongue-lashings from the prime minister's wife, Mrs. Sara Netanyahu'. It adds: 'The vast majority of which were with the prime minister's knowledge.' In one instance, Naftali said Mrs Netanyahu called him at 3am to complain that he had bought milk in a plastic storage bag instead of a carton, according to the lawsuit. In another, Naftali claimed that she chastised him because some flowers in a vase were a day old. The cross-examination stage of the civil suit began yesterday. Naftali told the court that when he initially met Mrs Netanyahu he did not know she drank 'crazy amounts' of alcohol. The lawsuit states Naftali worked long hours and received 'unrestrained tongue-lashings from the prime minister's wife, Mrs. Sara Netanyahu'. Mr Netanyahu waves to supporters (above) after claiming victory in Israel's election . 'When I [later] became the house manager I found out that she drinks about three bottles of champagne a day,' the Times of Israel reported him saying. She also pocketed thousands of pounds of profits by recycling bottles purchased by the state, Naftali added in an earlier interview. Mrs Netanyahu denied any abusive treatment and said any allegations were 'designed solely to sully' her reputation. Cochavit Dolev-Netzach, representing the prime minister, confronted Naftali with allegations he had exhibited violent behaviour. Naftali denied the claim. Further cross-examinations will include questioning Mrs Netanyahu and Ezra Saidoff, the deputy director general of the Prime Minister’s Office, Israeli daily Haaretz reported. Guy Eliyahu and Emmanuel Sela, two former employees, are expected to act as witnesses to back up Naftali. Mr Netanyahu stands on stage with his wife. Naftali told the court that when he initially met Mrs Netanyahu he did not know she drank 'crazy amounts' of alcohol . Mrs Netanyahu has received criticism since  the 1990s after it was alleged she squabbled with her staff. Meanwhile, the government's state comptroller found in February that 'excessive' amounts of public funds were spent by Mr Netanyahu and his wife on food, furniture and gardening at their state residence and private home. In a report by the official watchdog, it was claimed cleaning expenses in the home on the coastal city of Caesarea averaged more than £1,370 a month in taxpayer's money even though the couple only spent the occasional weekend there.","Meni Naftali also alleges he was repeatedly subjected to abusive language .

5505ff7899863c5ba437ade7b01b91ab3945be7b,"Colorado's legal marijuana is three times stronger than it was a generation ago and is often contaminated with heavy metals, pesticides, fungus and bacteria, a startling chemical analysis of 600 samples has found. Additionally, modern pot has very low levels of cannabidiol, or CBD, the compound that medical marijuana advocates say gives the drug its healing properties. In most samples, the CBD levels were so small they were undetectable. The findings come from Andy LaFrate, a Ph.D. chemist and the founder of Colorado testing firm Charas Scientific. LaFrate will present the results of his research today at the national meeting of the American Chemical Society in Denver. Scroll down for video . Andy LaFrate, the founder of Charas Scientific, knows that most people think it's a joke when he says he tested 600 samples of Colorado's legal pot . In fact, LaFrate used highly accurate liquid chromatography to isolate all of the compounds within the marijuana samples - and got some surprising results . LaFrate's survey of Colorado's marijuana casts doubt on claims that by legalizing the drug for recreational use in 2012, it would make it safer to consume. 'It's pretty startling just how dirty a lot of this stuff is,' he told Smithsonian.com. Also alarming is the fact that people using marijuana for its reported medicinal properties usually have no way of knowing how much CBD is actually in their products. Colorado only requires marijuana dispensaries to test and advertise the levels of THC - the compound in pot that gets user 'high.' CBD and contaminant levels are not tested. 'I've heard a lot of complaints from medical patients because somebody claims that a product has a high level of CBD, and it turns out that it actually doesn't,' LaFrate says. Children who are given marijuana to control epilepsy can actually be worse off because they're being given strains of the drug with virtually no CBD and high levels of THC, which can trigger seizures, he added. LaFrate's tests used liquid chromatography, a highly accurate method of chemical analysis that separates out the component parts of a substance. LaFrate says more testing is needed on the effects of contaminants on people who consume marijuana . He found that Colorado's legal marijuana has THC levels of 18 to 20percent. Sometimes THC is as high as 30percent. Marijuana from the 1980s usually had THC levels of less than 10percent - meaning modern pot is two to three times stronger than it was a generation ago. It's no coincidence that Colorado's marijuana is dramatically stronger and has dramatically lower CBD levels than the pot of yesteryear. Growers responded to a demand from consumers for more potent pot by breeding varieties with higher levels of THC and less CBD. LaFrate says he found very small levels of genetic variation between 'strains' of marijuana. This means, the claims of pot with exotic names - 'Skunkberry,' 'Ghost Train Haze,' 'Girl Scout Cookies' - are usually just slick marketing ploys. Additionally, much of Colorado's marijuana is contaminated with high levels of fungus spores and bacteria. It's not known what levels of those microorganisms are safe for marijuana and more study on the subject is needed, LaFrate says. Many samples also contained traces of cancer-causing heavy metals, which come from the plants growing in contaminated soil. Others had high levels of pesticides. LaFrate warned that the marijuana growing industry is getting by on it's hippy reputation and that many consumers believe the plants are grown naturally using organic methods - when in fact, that usually is not the case at all. Even more troubling were the 200 samples of marijuana concentrates - or pot extract - that LaFrate tested. These are used to make edibles and can contain up to 90percent THC. Because they are concentrated doses, they can also contain very high levels of heavy metals and pesticides - as the THC level is dialed up, so are the levels of background contaminants. The solvents used like alcohol and heptane to make the concentrates also contribute startling levels of contaminants, LaFrate warned.","Modern pot also has very low levels of cannabidiol, or CBD, the compound that advocates say gives marijuana its medicinal properties .

07fb00f8bca10c8cf8d5f90fbbb15fbed37927ab,"Snuggled up together and almost holding hands in their sleep, this is the heart-warming moment twin baby girls were reunited after spending their first six weeks apart as they battled for life. Darcey and Eden Mold, who were born six weeks premature and with holes in their hearts, were immediately placed in separate incubators. Weighing just 4lb 13oz each, they were wired up to a tangle of bleeping monitors, tubes and drips. After weeks of complications and treatments in hospital, the twins were finally well enough to go home and have their first cuddle in a Moses basket, dressed in matching pink sleep suits. Katy Mold, 31, gave birth to twin girls Darcey and Eden (pictured) after going into labour at the 34-week stage of her pregnancy and both girls were born with holes in their hearts - known as congenital heart defects . Parents Katy (pictured left with the twin girls) and David Mold (right), from Sway, Hampshire, have been in and out of Southampton General Hospital after both girls fell unwell after the birth and needed urgent care . Their mother Katy, 31, said yesterday: 'They're both little fighters. They really are both little miracles.' The twins were born just one minute apart in an emergency Caesarean on November 25, after Mrs Mold's waters broke 34 weeks into pregnancy when she choked on a crisp. Eden, who was born second, was immediately whisked away for checks and medication as she had large holes in her heart. Mrs Mold, who was wheeled in her hospital bed to visit the pair in intensive care nine hours after their birth, said: 'Just seeing them so small and so helpless, it was very hard. I couldn't hold them. Mrs Mold gave birth after her waters broke when she choked on a crisp. The girls weighed just 4lbs and 13oz when they were born (pictured) and while Darcey was allowed home straight away, Eden was kept in hospital . As well as being born with large holes in her heart, baby Eden (pictured in hospital) also had a condition which meant she had a narrowing of the aorta and had no septum between the two ventricles of the heart . 'Sitting around watching them in a box was the hardest thing.' But this was only the start of an emotional roller coaster for Mrs Mold, a college secretary, and her husband David, 47, who runs an event management business. When Eden was eight days old, she had to have a six-hour operation to repair narrowing of her aorta, the large blood vessel in the heart, and to have her pulmonary artery 'banded' to reduce blood flow to her lungs. The operation was a success but days later Darcey, who had been allowed to go home because her heart condition was not life-threatening, turned blue and was rushed back to Southampton General Hospital where her sister was recovering. While baby Darcey (pictured) was originally allowed home after birth, she was taken into intensive care just weeks later after being struck down with a severe case of bronchiolitis - a lower respiratory tract infection . Both Eden (left) and Darcey (right) spent six weeks apart while both were cared for on different wards at Southampton General Hospital. They have since been allowed home and are now three-months-old . The girls are pictured enjoying their first cuddle together at just five-days-old. They were later separated for six weeks while Eden received heart surgery and Darcey was cared for in intensive care for a chest infection . Diagnosed with bronchiolitis, a respiratory infection, Darcey spent 12 days sedated and ventilated and had to be given a blood transfusion. Eden was finally well enough to go home on New Year's Eve and Darcey on January 2. They joined their sisters, Matilda, six, and Jemima, nine, at the family home in Sway, Hampshire. Now nearly four months old, the twins are both making a good recovery, although Eden faces further heart surgery this year, when surgeons will patch up the holes in her heart. Mrs Mold said: 'I feel like I have been running on this rollercoaster of adrenaline ever since the birth ... I've been constantly on red alert, worried my children might die. I feel very lucky that both my girls are okay at the moment.' She added: 'Everyone at the hospital was amazing. 'The care we've had has been second to none ... I'm glad they're both better and doing well, we couldn't be prouder.' Congenital heart defects are problems with the heart's structure that are present at birth. These defects change the normal flow of blood through the heart. The heart has two sides, separated by an inner wall called the septum. With each heartbeat, the right side of the heart receives oxygen-poor blood from the body and pumps it to the lungs. The left side of the heart receives oxygen-rich blood from the lungs and pumps it to the body. The septum prevents mixing of blood between the two sides of the heart. However, some babies are born with holes in the upper or lower septum. A hole in the septum between the heart's two upper chambers is called an atrial septal defect (ASD). A hole in the septum between the heart's two lower chambers is called a ventricular septal defect (VSD). ASDs and VSDs allow blood to pass from the left side of the heart to the right side. Thus, oxygen-rich blood mixes with oxygen-poor blood. As a result, some oxygen-rich blood is pumped to the lungs instead of the body. Children who have simple congenital heart defects can survive to adulthood. They can live normal, active lives because their heart defects close on their own or have been repaired. - National Heart, Lung and Blood Institute .

The glut of top grades at GCSE and A-level is forcing employers to focus on young people’s extra-curricular activities, according to a business leader. John Cridland – director general of the Confederation of British Industry – said his members must consider character-building elements of a candidate’s CV, rather than just qualifications. He told the Times Educational Supplement that ‘frankly everybody has A*s’ and said employers want someone who ‘stands out from the crowd’. ‘What have you done in the local theatre club? 'What have you done in the local sports club? 'What have you done to put something back into the community?’ he said. ‘[These] are just as important to employers.’ He added that most bosses ‘do not recruit on subject or qualification’ but look for ‘enthusiasm, creativity and passion’. The CBI has previously bemoaned the poor quality of candidates entering the workplace, criticising levels of numeracy and literacy. However Mr Cridland stopped short of suggesting ‘character’ should be taught as a separate subject, saying: ‘A good teacher develops these things in the classroom while teaching English.’ He added that Ofsted inspections should focus more on the all-round development of pupils.

The world's most expensive player has come in for sustained criticism during his second season at Real Madrid, but Coleman said: 'I think I'd be on dangerous ground if I said to Baley: 'I need a bit more from you.'' Coleman spoke after naming his squad featuring Bale, Aaron Ramsey, Joe Allen and Ashley Williams. Sam Vokes was also called up for the first time in 12 months following his serious knee injury.

Bale could be handed a free role should Vokes feature at centre-forward in the key Euro 2016 qualifying clash in Israel, but Coleman suggested any appearance would be from the bench. Coleman said the Burnley striker, who contributed significantly to their 1-0 win over Manchester City, needs 'a little bit more' action before he is considered match-fit. Coleman believes Bale can benefit from being back among his Wales colleagues. 'There us not much more we can ask of Baley, he keeps coming and giving what he' s got,' said Coleman.

Coleman said Bale was 'caught in the middle' at Real but 'will come through'. 'People say he's had a bad season but Real are in the quarter finals of the Champions League, still with a chance of La Liga, and he has scored 16 goals and god knows how many assists.

227d385dbddba51240e4b62fce6b80bdb5c0fab0,"I can’t wait to compete at the European Indoor Championships in Prague, which is the biggest competition of the season so far. For multi-eventers, packing your suitcase to go abroad can be a bit of an ordeal. I noticed it more last year when I just did long jump at the World Indoors and I only had to take one pair of trainers. With pentathlon I’ve got five different pairs of spikes for the hurdles, high jump, shot putt, long jump and 800m. All kinds of things come with being a multi-eventer and making sure you have room in your case is just one of them. It was easy for this weekend because I’m not away for long so will pretty much live in my GB kit and a couple of pairs of jeans. Britain's Katarina Johnson-Thompson spoke about her preparations for the European Indoor Championships . The 22-year-old athlete will be competing in the pentathlon in this year's indoor championships in Prague . Normally at Championships I room with Holly Bleasdale or Jodie Williams but neither of them are competing in the indoors this season so I don’t know who I’ll be in a room with this time – you get the chance to pick but I just left the box empty. Sprinters normally have their events in the afternoon so they can stay up later and sleep in whereas I’m always on first thing so it’s more about trying to find someone that matches your timetable than your personality. I’m just competing for the one day on Friday so I’ll have the rest of the weekend just to relax and be a spectator so it will definitely be good to do that. As well as being supported by the National Lottery I am supported by the philanthropist Barrie Wells, who also sponsors Jenny Meadows so I’ll be with him in the crowd cheering her on and holding a banner for the 800m final on Sunday. If I’m rooting for any athlete other than myself it’s going to be Jenny because she’s had such a tough past. She’s been so unlucky not just with injuries but competing with lots of drugs cheats in her event. I’m glad athletics is being cleaned up because to have an equal playing field means so much to us as athletes. You dedicate your life to it and it’s so upsetting to think someone might be getting an unfair advantage and there’s literally nothing you can do about it. It’s definitely good that all the drugs cheats are getting exposed and it’s going to be a clean sport. I’ve got personal bests in the long jump and high jump already this season. The last time I did pentathlon was 2012 because I didn’t do an indoor season in 2013 and last year I was ill. I was a little kiddy in 2012 so I definitely should be getting one this time. The Liverpudlian is confident after recording personal bests in the long jump and high jump this season . I feel like a different person since I had a foot injury, which ruled me out of the Commonwealth Games and European Championships last year. I can’t really pinpoint what has changed I just enjoy being out there and I’m not nervous to compete any more. Sometimes before the injury I used to think: “I just want to be a normal teenager or young person” but I realised it was this that I love and enjoy. It made me realise what I will be missing out on. I’ve been focussing so much on the indoors that I haven’t had chance to do a lot of javelin training which is one of my weakest events. I’m really looking forward to my next session with the British number one Goldie Sayers, who is helping me work on my technique, in April. Away from competition, there’s been a new addition to my household - I’ve got another sausage dog as a companion to Chorizo. I’ve called him Bronx. I wanted to call him Richmond to stick with the sausage themed names but my boyfriend said it was too posh and I was trying to push the sausage names too much! He’s well trained though, much better than Chorizo. I think it’s like having children - you make more mistakes with the first one and then correct them with the second!

While the 85-year-old Palmer has vowed to overcome a shoulder injury to fulfil his ceremonial tee-off role at the Masters, Woods is still trying to get his game in shape. The former world No. 1 has competed only twice this year, missing the cut at the Phoenix Open in early February before withdrawing in the first round of the Farmers Insurance Open due to his ongoing back problems. ""Tiger called me personally to let me know that he wouldn't be playing here at Bay Hill,"" Palmer said on his PGA Tour event's website. ""He said that his game is not quite ready yet and that he was disappointed that he won't be able to play in the tournament, which has always meant a lot to him. I'm sorry that he won't be playing. We'll certainly miss him, but I understand and appreciated that he called me."" Woods has won the Arnold Palmer Invitational a record eight times, the last of which came in 2013. However, he has not added to his total of 14 major wins since 2008, but hopes to be in contention at Augusta from April 9-12. ""I've put in a lot of time and work on my game and I'm making strides, but like I've said, I won't return to the PGA Tour until my game is tournament ready and I can compete at the highest level,"" the 39-year-old said on his website. ""I hope to be ready for the Masters, and I will continue to work hard preparing for Augusta."" Palmer first hosted the Bay Hill tournament in 1979 and it took his name from 2007. It raises money for two Florida hospitals named for the seven-time major winner and his late wife Winnie. ""I am so proud of what has been accomplished at the hospitals over the past 25 years. It is always a privilege to know that we are making a difference in the lives of families throughout the community,"" said Palmer after his medical center was named one of the best for children in the U.S. for 2014-15. He hurt his shoulder in December after tripping on carpet when he was about to make a speech at a PGA Tour father/son event.

A sold-out Wembley witnessed the latest chapter of the 21-year-old's fairytale rise, which has seen him go from Tottenham squad player to the country's most lethal frontman in just a matter of months. Kane was welcomed by a standing ovation when he came on as a second-half substitute and it took just 80 seconds for him to get the fans back on their feet, heading home with one of his first touches to wrap up a 4-0 win against Lithuania.

'He has been doing it in training as well this week. He is on fire and we're delighted for him. 'He has been brilliant this season. He thoroughly deserved his call-up and the lads are delighted for him in the dressing room to score his first goal. He has been lively, he is a great lad and he has been scoring a lot of goals.'

8d030061420c152857f64b5eaf9a6d7b9d7c6c9a,"A Christian blogger and mother-of-four who begged fellow cancer sufferer Brittany Maynard not to end her life has died aged 38. Kara Tippetts, an author from Colorado Springs, Colorado, passed away on Sunday after a lengthy battle with breast cancer, a friend wrote on Tippetts' website, Mundane Faithfulness. 'She refused to be defined by cancer and considered every moment a gift and an opportunity to learn more about Grace and trusting God,' friend Blythe Hunt wrote. Last October, Tippetts penned an open letter to Maynard, a terminal brain cancer patient and a physician-assisted suicide advocate who had decided to take her own life before her suffering worsened. Loss: Kara Tippetts, an author and a married mother-of-four pictured undergoing chemotherapy last year, passed away on Sunday following a lengthy battle with breast cancer. She was just 38 . Tippetts wrote to her: 'You have been told a lie. A horrible lie, that your dying will not be beautiful. That the suffering will be too great. 'I pray (my words) reach the multitudes that are looking at your story and believing the lie that suffering is a mistake, that dying isn't to be braved, that choosing our death is the courageous story.' She went on: 'In your choosing your own death, you are robbing those that love you with the such tenderness, the opportunity of meeting you in your last moments and extending you love in your last breaths.' But Tippetts also thanked Maynard for sharing her story and told her she loved her. Speaking in an earlier interview, Maynard had explained: 'There is not a cell in my body that is suicidal or that wants to die. I want to live. I wish there was a cure for my disease but there's not.' Plea: She famously penned an open letter to Brittany Maynard, the 29-year-old brain cancer sufferer (pictured) who took her life last November. Tippetts had pleaded with Maynard to die naturally . Maynard, who was married, died on November 1, 2014 aged just 29. After the letter was shared thousands of times online, Tippetts' book, 'The Hardest Peace', soared to number 14 on Amazon's bestseller list. Tippetts said she was shocked. 'I knew I wanted (Maynard) to be able to hear my letter and feel my love, but I never expected to be in this position,' she told the Colorado Springs Gazette. 'I never expected to be this voice, but it's an important conversation so I'm entering it.' Tippetts also leaves behind her husband Jason, whom she married in 1998, and their children Eleanor Grace, Harper Joy, Lake Edward and Story Jane. Her husband founded the Westside Church in Colorado Springs. In December, her publishers confirmed she had entered hospice care. Family: Tippetts, a Christian blogger, is pictured with her pastor husband Jason and their four children . Final post: On March 12, she shared this picture to Facebook showing her with her husband Jason, writing: 'Today I'm fading, I can see it in the tears in his eyes... May we continue to enjoy each moment' In her final blog post on March 10, Tippetts said a nurse had told her she had just days to live - 'News I frankly don't believe,' she wrote. 'I do see where cancer is having it's way with my body,' she went on. 'Where I'm growing weaker or pain is growing stronger. It's been made clear to me I'm fading. I'm just in denial... 'I feel too young to be in this battle, but maybe I'm not in a battle at all. Maybe I'm on a journey, and the journey is more beautiful than any of us can comprehend.' Then on March 12, she shared a photo to Facebook showing her smiling beside her husband. 'Today I'm fading, I can see it in the tears in his eyes,' she wrote. 'There is going to be grace for this...

bc36a147512b40853a76e4fc297e1c98d4e54841,"If Eoin Morgan really believes what he said after England's miserable World Cup ended with an anti-climactic win over Afghanistan at a near-empty Sydney Cricket Ground, then they are in even more trouble than we thought. The England one-day captain was either protecting his players or is in total denial after an early World Cup exit caused by England's extreme limitations in the 50-over format being repeatedly, brutally and embarrassingly exposed. It is the only explanation for Morgan insisting he had 'no regrets' and, even more bizarrely, saying that he felt all the England players who have under-performed so spectacularly here should carry on in the one-day blue clothing. England captain Eoin Morgan insists he and his side have 'no regrets' over their early World Cup exit . Morgan (second left) walks off the field with Ian Bell (third left) as rain delays play on Friday . This was another deflating day for England even if they did win their final, meaningless group match with ease on a soggy day in Sydney against a willing but mediocre team of minnows in Afghanistan. It was a game that was hardly worth playing and one that even the 9,000 present would have been happy to see rained off so that they could watch the far more entertaining New Zealand win over Bangladesh on TV. The statistics, if we dare bring those up, will tell you that England were businesslike in restricting Afghanistan to 111 for seven off 36.2 overs before knocking off their revised target of 101 in 25 overs with 41 balls to spare. But then came another strange press conference from a captain who has been a massive disappointment since taking over from Alastair Cook on the eve of this tournament, not least with the bat. England batsman James Taylor plays a shot as Afghanistan wicket-keeper Afsar Zazai watches on . Bell shakes hands with Afghanistan players following England's hollow consolation win at the World Cup . 'There are no regrets, absolutely not. We gave it everything,' Morgan insisted after England had managed to equal statistically their worst ever World Cup by defeating a second minnow in Afghanistan as well as Scotland. Only in 1996 have they had such a shocker, on that occasion beating just Holland and the UAE. Then came the bombshell that a team who have failed dismally to come anywhere close to the pace being set by the leading nations in this tournament should all carry on towards the 2019 World Cup. When Morgan was asked if England should make changes as they play catch-up in one-day cricket, he said: 'No, absolutely not. We haven't got guys who are coming towards the end of their careers. I don't see any reason why any of them should retire. I think we have the right calibre of squad. Guys on the outside need to be banging down the door. It's an easy thing to sit here while we're not doing well and say someone outside the squad is better. We considered everybody when we selected the squad and I still believe we had the right group of players here.' Bell plays a shot during England's match against Afghanistan at the Sydney Cricket Ground . Taylor (left) and Morgan celebrate the wicket of Afghanistan's Samiullah Shinwari during Friday's win . England batsman Alex Hales plays a shot during the final match of England's poor World Cup campaign . That may be so but if the time is not ripe for change now, then we may as well all give up on the 50-over format and go home. For instance, Ian Bell made an unbeaten 52 yesterday in his 161st one-day international but surely that must be his final appearance in a one-day shirt, whether he retires or is dropped. Also, there seems no point in either Jimmy Anderson or Stuart Broad slogging away in one-day cricket for little reward when there is the small matter of 17 Tests coming up in 10 months, starting with a tour of the West Indies.Then there is the position of the captain himself, who said he was 'hungry' to carry on at the helm. Yet Morgan is not hungry enough, it seems, to lead England in their next one-day international, against Ireland in Dublin in May. Instead he will be at the Indian Premier League even though the coach of his Hyderabad team, Tom Moody, has intimated that Morgan is a squad player and is likely to remain on the bench rather than in the action. The bottom line is that England should have been heading to Melbourne today for a World Cup quarter-final against an India team they defeated twice in the tri-series here before their world fell apart. They could even have won that and reached the semi-finals, and from there who knows what might have happened. What a wasted opportunity. What a reality check for English one-day cricket. And if Morgan truly believes that no changes need to be made now, then he is the wrong man to take England forward after this disaster of a World Cup. England's win over Afghanistan attracted only a handful of supporters to conclude a dismal World Cup . Despite their early exit the World Cup, Morgan suggests England should stick with the current squad .","Eoin Morgan says he has 'no regrets' over England's woeful World Cup exit .

84cabce918203ea0d207e0269c4bb3f8b1d32e88,"David Cameron today puts the prospect of Alex Salmond ‘calling the tune’ in a deal with Labour at the centre of the Tory election campaign. As he launches a poster showing a tiny Ed Miliband in Mr Salmond’s pocket, the Prime Minister warns of the ‘chilling and real prospect’ of Labour being propped up in government by the Scottish National Party. His offensive comes after a day in which four members of Labour’s shadow cabinet refused repeatedly to say whether they would do a deal with the SNP in the event of a hung parliament. Scroll down for video . Pocket-size: Ed Miliband is dwarfed by Alex Salmond in the new Conservative election poster . Polls last week suggested the nationalists could win 50 out of the 59 Westminster seats in May, including those seen as the safest Labour strongholds such as Gordon Brown’s in Kirkcaldy. This would sink any prospect of Mr Miliband winning a Commons majority. Mr Cameron says today: ‘Britain needs to wake up to a chilling and real prospect – Ed Miliband as prime minister, propped up by Alex Salmond who says he’ll call the tune. ‘Again and again, Ed Miliband refuses to rule out this possibility. He is so weak, everyone knows he would be in Alex Salmond’s pocket. On every vote, every budget, every decision, the SNP would exact a high price for his support. ‘Everyone in Britain will pay with higher taxes, more spending, more debt and weaker defences in dangerous times. To keep the recovery on track and avoid this nightmare, vote Conservative.’ The Prime Minister's offensive comes after a day in which four members of Labour’s shadow cabinet refused repeatedly to say whether they would do a deal with the SNP in the event of a hung parliament . A Labour parliamentary candidate has rejected a £1,000 donation from Tony Blair towards her election campaign. Lesley Brennan, who is standing in Dundee East, said on Twitter her ‘instinct’ was to turn the offer down. The former Prime Minister has pledged £106,000 to help Labour campaigns in 106 marginal seats. But there has been unease about Mr Blair’s links to foreign corporations and dictatorships and candidates have been under pressure to hand back the so-called ‘blood money’. Mr Miliband is under huge pressure from his Scottish MPs to rule out a deal with the nationalists. Yesterday his deputy Harriet Harman dodged the issue eight times on the Murnaghan show on Sky. Labour energy spokesman Caroline Flint refused four times to rule out a deal with the nationalists on the Andrew Marr Show on BBC1. She said: ‘We are focused on winning a Labour majority government. Let me say this. We do not want, we do not need and we do not plan to have any coalition with the SNP.’ Shadow justice secretary Sadiq Khan dodged the question four times on Pienaar’s Politics on Radio 5 Live and shadow Scotland secretary Margaret Curran did so nine times on the BBC’s Sunday Politics. On Friday, Mr Salmond, the former SNP leader who is expected to lead the party in Westminster after the election, said Scotland could ‘call the tune’ in the Commons. ‘It is now clear that neither Tory nor Labour will win an overall majority,’ he said. ‘Neither are fit to govern. ‘It is also clear that Scotland is swinging behind SNP candidates the length and breadth of the country. In that situation Scotland can call the tune in the next Westminster Parliament.’ At the same time, Scottish First Minister Nicola Sturgeon removed the biggest obstacle to a Labour-SNP deal by ditching her red line on Trident. She said her party could back a minority Labour government in key votes even if it had not secured an agreement to scrap the nuclear deterrent. Labour MPs say the party has ‘decided internally’ not to rule out an SNP pact before the election. This will be particularly concerning to English voters who fear the price of concessions the SNP will seek to extract from Labour in return for handing Mr Miliband the keys to No 10. Peeping from the breast pocket of a giant Alex Salmond, Ed Miliband is portrayed as a mere plaything of the SNP in the Tories’ latest poster. Lips pursed, he appears pensive and childlike as the larger-than-life Scottish nationalist looks down on him with a patronising smirk. The poster’s clear aim is to suggest Mr Salmond will have free rein to boss Mr Miliband around if their parties form a coalition in May. Last night the pair were immediately dubbed ‘Big Eck and Little Ed’. The Tory campaign drew comparisons to ITV’s Spitting Image, which mercilessly lampooned politicians in the 1980s and 1990s. Its targets included David Owen and David Steel, joint leaders of the SDP/Liberal Alliance. Mr Steel was lampooned as Mr Owen’s adoring sidekick and sometimes appeared in his pocket, left.

ff509de72a09a711874e13418dfae2ffc2864eed,"Manchester City go into Wednesday night's Champions League game against Barcelona knowing that only a win - and a win in which they score twice - will be enough to secure progress. It might therefore worry them to know that beating Barcelona is something that their manager, Manuel Pellegrini, has failed to manage since 2008. Pellegrini has now managed three clubs without any successes against Barca, losing all of his games so far as manager of City to match his record at Real Madrid, and managing just a single draw when in charge of Malaga. Manchester City manager Manuel Pellegrini has lost 12 of his last 13 games against Barcelona . The last time Pellegrini beat Barcelona, in 2008, Yaya Toure was playing for the Spanish club . In fact, you have to go back to March 2008, more than eight years ago, to find Pellegrini's last win over Barcelona, on a day that his star man Yaya Toure was lining up for the Nou Camp outfit. As Villarreal boss Pellegrini did manage four wins against Barca, while drawing three times and losing the remaining five of his twelve games. However, only the last of those wins came away from home, and none of them in the Champions League, while his career record against Barcelona sees him triumph only 16 per cent of the time. City know they need to produce something special to progress - if they do beat Luis Enrique's team by the required margin, it will not just be a remarkable achievement for the club, but also for their manager.

a7b11070c3a21d3aa0c77d1e3babf777dfef8ad7,"Four lingerie-clad women drew on their bodies with Sharpie markers to highlight their physical shortcomings - like a plastic surgeon during a consultation - for a powerful photo series that ridicules the media's depiction of female bodies. Sarah Coffman from San Diego, California, enlisted three friends, whom she refers to as Tiffany Stevens, Rose Lee and Ashley A, for the provocative photoshoot, which was shot by photographer Terrance Smalls. The images from the aptly-named Lines Series show the women reading magazine featuring models and actresses while they sit in a doctor's office waiting room covered in marker. 'We live in a society where women are constantly being stripped down and evaluated, without physically being stripped down,' Terrance explained on his website. Powerful message: Sarah Coffman (center) stood up while Tiffany Stevens(left) and Rose Lee (right) pointed out her flaws in the provocative photo series shot by Terrance Smalls . Media pressure: The three women read the popular men's magazine Maxim, famous for featuring scantily-clad women on its cover, while they sit in a waiting room in their underwear . Dream girls: The trio, who used Sharpie markers to highlight their physical flaws, pointed and stared at the models in Vogue . He continued: 'Well, what does it look like when we actually strip women down and evaluate their physical ""shortcomings""? How insane does it look? How uncomfortable does it make us feel? The purpose of this series was to find out.' Sarah, Tiffany and Rose wore patterned bras and underwear and donned coiffed hair and a faces full of make-up for the series, which puts a bold spin on pin-up inspired photoshoots. Terrance explained that their over-the-top beauty looks were a 'conscious decision' that they made to further drive their point across. 'Yes, the ladies are wearing a lot of makeup (more than they would if they were just going out) and yes, the images have been retouched,' he noted. Body anxiety: Tara can be seen agonizing over her body as she stares in the mirror in this photo . Ridiculous standards: The three women were photographed as they made faces at the pictures they were seeing the magazines . Can't compare: Rose and Sarah look shocked as they stare at the models in the magazines they are reading . Look here: Rose held a magazine while Tara and Sarah pointed at images that caught their attention . Mean girls: Sarah and Rose sneered at Tara, who was sitting between them and obliviously reading Maxim . Meanwhile, Ashley sported a more business oriented look and posed in a camisole and a pencil skirt before she shed her clothes and exposed the markings on her body. All of the women had lines and arrows drawn over their breasts, on areas of their stomachs and around their arms and thighs, highlighting what many might perceive to be their ‘problem’ areas. While the series was created last August, Sarah, 23, who goes by the name ‘nerdygypsy’ online, shared the images on Reddit yesterday, writing: 'So my friends and I put on a photoshoot a few months back, this became the result.' She continued: 'We were trying to more or less expose the ridiculousness involved in photoshoots.' Touch up: Terrance explained that it was a 'conscious decision' for the models to wear more make-up than they do in real life . Baring all: Rose wore a hot pink bra and a black thong with pink bows during the photoshoot . Eye contact: Rose put her hands on her hips as she looked over her shoulder at the camera and flaunted her derriere . Strike a pose: The photo series proves that women are insecure about their bodies no matter what the size because of how the media portrays female bodies . The girls can be seen measuring each other's waists, pointing out their flaws with their fingers, staring at their bodies in the mirror and pouring over men's magazines in the images that aim to start a discussion about body image. When Terrance first posted some of the images to is Instagram account in 2014, he received an overwhelmingly positive response from his followers. 'That's what true beauty is. Not afraid to be and show urself for who u really are. Spite what other people say or think of you [sic],' one person wrote, while another commented: 'Great message.'

4f6898b7d167981aad3a6330f216c5c6b0cb9f00,"Tim Tebow, whose stint as a National Football League quarterback briefly sparked 'Tebow-mania', spent Monday trying to make a comeback in a workout for the Philadelphia Eagles. But after one day of training, Tebow left without being signed, according to ESPN NFL insider Adam Schefter. The 27-year-old  who once played for the Denver Broncos and New York Jets performed for the Eagles and coach Chip Kelly in hopes of trying out for a quarterback position, a source told AP. Tim Tebow, pictured in August 20123, trained with the Philadelphia Eagles on Monday in an attempt to try out for a quarterback position . Considering all the offseason moves made by  Kelly, taking a look at the 2007 Heisman Trophy winner with the huge following shouldn't be a surprise. It has been speculated that Tebow could run zone-read plays better than Philadelphia's four current quarterbacks. Tebow elicited interest from millions of fans in large part for his public displays of religious faith on and off the field, a head-bowing genuflecting move on one knee that became known as 'Tebowing' in the wake of his success. In 2011, Tebow began the season as a backup with the Denver Broncos but was given a chance to start after a 1-4 start. Tebow sparked a string of come-from-behind victories and led Denver into the playoffs and an upset of Pittsburgh in the first round. But Tebow's 47-per cent pass-completion rate was the worst in the NFL that season and when the Broncos signed Peyton Manning in 2012, Tebow became expendable. He was sent to the Jets in a trade. Tebow was seldom used even as Jets starter Mark Sanchez struggled. He was released in 2013 having thrown only eight passes and run just 32 times in his lone season in New York. The New England Patriots made Tebow one of their final roster cuts in 2013 and he spent last year as a college gridiron television commentator when no NFL team wanted him. Tebow, pictured here in August 2013, left training on Monday without signing with the Eagles. But ESPN NFL insider Adam Schefter left the idea open, claiming 'We'll see if anything changes' Tebow was being assessed by an Eagles team that features Sanchez, who joined Philadelphia after his own departure from the Jets, and Sam Bradford, a quarterback who missed most of last season with a torn left knee ligament. Bradford was the second sophomore player to win the Heisman Trophy as the top college player, doing so in 2008. Tebow had been the first in 2007. Tebow has an 8-6 record as an NFL starting quarterback with a career 48-per cent completion rate for 2,422 yards with 17 touchdowns and nine interceptions. Schefter announced on Twitter that the Eagles decided not to sign Tebow, but left the option open. 'Tim Tebow has come and gone from Philadelphia. Team is not planning to sign him at this time. We'll see if anything changes,' he wrote. Kelly's remake of the Eagles' roster has included trading star running back LeSean McCoy to Buffalo, then signing Offensive Player of the Year DeMarco Murray to replace him. Clearly, Kelly - who took over personnel duties after last season - is unafraid to look anywhere for possible upgrades. Although Tebow had some success in Denver, his inaccurate passing and lack of pocket presence has plagued him in the NFL. His strength has been running the ball or improvising. There's also been some thought that Tebow might switch to tight end or fullback, although he has balked at such a move in the past. The Eagles have depth at tight end, but no fullbacks on the roster.","Tebow spent one day of training with team before leaving .

d68812bef2ce1b1ce75cdaf1efb924b8c6f08626,"(CNN)Embattled Ferguson Police Chief Thomas Jackson resigned Wednesday, a week after a scathing Justice Department report slammed his department. Jackson and the city ""have agreed to a mutual separation,"" Ferguson officials announced. ""It's a really hard pill to swallow,"" Jackson said in a text message responding to CNN's request for comment. He also confirmed his resignation in a letter to Ferguson's mayor. ""It is with profound sadness that I am announcing I am stepping down from my position as chief of police for the city of Ferguson, Missouri,"" Jackson said, adding that serving the city as police chief ""has been an honor and a privilege."" The resignation will go into effect March 19, Jackson said, to ""provide for an orderly transition of command."" ""I will continue to assist the city in any way I can in my capacity as private citizen,"" Jackson wrote. But even though he's about to be out of a job, Jackson will still collect a paycheck. Jackson will receive a severance payment and health insurance for one year, the city said, with Lt. Col. Al Eickhoff assuming his duties during a nationwide search for a new chief. Ferguson Mayor James Knowles said he couldn't go into details about the personnel discussions behind the decision to give Jackson a year of severance pay. ""I think it's fair to say that in many executive level private industries, you would get a similar treatment,"" he said. Knowles said the police chief decided to resign ""after a lot of soul searching."" ""I think it's important that we recognize that the chief made this decision because he wanted to do this,"" Knowles said. ""He thought it was the best for the city and the Police Department."" Hours after the announcement, protesters gathered outside the Ferguson Police Department. ""Fight back,"" many chanted as they faced a long line of police officers. At least two people were arrested, CNN affiliate KMOV said, but it was not immediately clear why. As of late Wednesday night, the protest was largely peaceful. Jackson's resignation is the latest fallout from the Justice Department report, which exposed problems in the city's policing tactics and faulted Ferguson's officers for seeing residents as ""sources of revenue,"" a practice that federal investigators said disproportionately targeted African-Americans. The investigators also found evidence of racist jokes being sent around by Ferguson police and court officials. Ferguson City Manager John Shaw stepped down Tuesday. The report mentions both men by name. Two police officers resigned last week and the city's top court clerk was fired in connection with racist emails, city spokesman Jeff Small said on Friday. Last week, Jackson declined to comment on details in the report. ""I need to have time to really analyze this report so I can comment on it,"" Jackson told CNN Thursday. When asked what he planned to do about the report's findings, the chief said he would ""take action as necessary."" After his resignation Wednesday, he said in a written statement to CNN's Don Lemon that he was encouraged by the report's conclusion, which says that Ferguson ""has the capacity to reform its approach to law enforcement."" ""We agree that Ferguson can do the tough work to see this through and emerge the best small town it can be,"" he said. Knowles told reporters Wednesday that the city is still analyzing the report. ""We continue to go through that report and talk about where the breakdown was,"" he said. ""The chief, being an honorable man, decided we needed to talk about the way moving forward was with someone else. He left."" City officials, he said, still believe the Police Department can be reformed without being eliminated. ""The city of Ferguson looks to become an example of how a community can move forward in the face of adversity,"" the mayor said. ""We are committed to keeping our Police Department and having one that exhibits the highest degree of professionalism and fairness."" When Jackson became Ferguson's police chief in 2010, it was supposed to be a relatively easy way to cap his career in law enforcement. After some 30 years with the St. Louis County Police Department, serving as commander of a drug task force and SWAT team supervisor, being a police chief of a smaller department should have been less stressful. The shooting of Michael Brown last year changed everything. Brown, an African-American teen, was unarmed when he was shot by a white Ferguson police officer. The incident exposed feelings of distrust between Ferguson's black community and its police department,  which is overwhelmingly white. Darren Wilson, the officer who shot Brown, won't face any criminal charges for the shooting. In November, a grand jury decided not to indict him. Last week the Justice Department said Wilson's actions ""do not constitute prosecutable violations"" of federal civil rights law. He resigned from the department in November, citing security concerns. But that hasn't stopped criticism of the department from local residents and top federal officials. Even before the Justice Department report was finished, U.S. Attorney General Eric Holder said it was ""pretty clear that the need for wholesale change in that department is appropriate."" Critics have accused Jackson of inflaming tensions in the St. Louis suburb with his response to the shooting. Over the past six months, Jackson has defended his officers and vowed to work with the community. ""I intend to see this thing through. And I've been working with a lot of community members to work on some progressive changes that will bring the community together and to open up dialogue and getting us all talking about serious issues and actually creating solutions to problems,"" he told CNN in November. CNN's Jason Carroll contributed to this report.","Protesters gather outside the Ferguson Police Department, chanting ""Fight back""

ece92ffd3a149ecbf4b9702527b36a22d96e497a,"(CNN)Kids, being kids, like to climb on things. More often than not, that's OK. But when the thing in question is a war memorial? That's the question burning up online parenting groups and in family rooms after an amateur photographer snapped a picture of two children scampering on top of the Vietnam Women's Memorial in Washington. The photographer, Matt Munson, described the shot on Facebook as ""two little brats climbing over war memorial right in front of a veteran."" The parents, he said, were laughing. ""It actually drew a crowd of spectators and the parents realized how evil they were being and quickly took off before I could take a picture of them all,"" Munson wrote. ""The more I look at this photo the angrier I get."" He has plenty of company there. As the photo went viral, comment after comment poured in on Facebook and Twitter, chastising the parents for allowing the kids to play on the statue, part of the Vietnam Veterans Memorial that depicts three women tending to a wounded soldier. One nurse cradles the wounded fighter while another looks despairingly into an empty helmet. The third looks skyward, to a rescue helicopter or perhaps God, according to the memorial foundation's website. In Munson's photo, a visitor to the memorial seems to grimace at the sight as he pushes an older man in a wheelchair. The older man, wearing a Navy ballcap, and a woman also look on. The children's parents aren't shown. Disgusting. ""Disgusting,"" Facebook user Trisha Davidson wrote of the children's actions. ""So wrong,"" Twitter user karsonwithak chimed in. But not everyone was upset. ""I fully take why people can get annoyed and respect that,"" Reddit user z3k3 wrote. But the writer said a grandfather who was a veteran of World War II ""loved watching the kids play on the local memorial."" ""He saw it as a way for the next generation to take some joy out of something so terrible and at the same time gave them a link to the past as many would stop to read the names or even get interested enough to read up on the subject a little,"" z3k3 wrote. Fair enough, some said. But some memorials are meant to be interactive. Others aren't. And a statue depicting a nurse caring for a gravely wounded man just doesn't seem to be the place for play, a Reddit user with the screen name nickfree wrote. ""Unless the memorial is designed to be climbed on -- unless the message of the memorial is clearly 'use me, interact with me, to help carry my message' (e.g. memorial benches), the default is leave it respectfully alone,"" nickfree wrote. On the Mommyish parenting blog, associate editor Maria Guido wrote that ""there's nothing wrong with children who may not understand how gleefully playing all over a memorial may seem inappropriate to some."" ""If these kids were just doing that -- gleefully playing all over a memorial -- I wouldn't find anything wrong with the image, actually. But they're not,"" she wrote. ""These parents were disrespectful,"" she wrote. ""The kids were being kids and following their directives."" Though the National Parks Service, which operates the memorial, didn't immediately respond to a request for comment, the Vietnam Veterans Memorial Fund urged visitors to treat veterans memorials -- sites of powerful and often emotional pilgrimages for many who served -- with respect. ""Please remember to be respectful to memorials honoring and remembering our nation's veterans,"" the group wrote on Facebook. ""We hope our visitors understand this moving forward.""","A photo of children playing on Vietnam Women's Memorial draws anger .

Lizzie Velasquez has known the torment of being mocked by bullies from around the world. As a 17-year-old surfing the web, she came across a video of herself on YouTube that described her as the 'world's ugliest woman'. The devastated teenager spent days shutting herself from the world behind a wall of tears, thinking her life was over. But now 26, the inspirational woman has hit back at the trolls with an anti-bullying documentary about her life, describing her battle with a rare condition which stops her putting on weight. 'A Brave Heart: The Lizzie Velasquez Story' premiers at the South by Southwest Film Festival in Austin, Texas, today. The 78-minute film charts Lizzie's inspiring path from cyber-bullying victim to anti-bullying activist. Featuring details of Lizzie's emotional and physical journey through the years, it follows her progress as she attempts to lobby the US government for the first federal anti-bullying Bill. She was born with Marfan syndrome and lipodystrophy, which is a problem with the way fat is distributed in the body. At only 5ft 2ins tall, Lizzie only weighs 58lbs - just over four stone. 'All we had known all my life was that I had a syndrome which meant that I couldn't gain weight. 'At the time, I thought everyone looked like me. I didn't recognise or tell that they didn't look like me.' Lizzie, born with a rare condition which prevents her from gaining weight, was tormented by bullies at school but was shocked to discover thousands of cruel comments on a YouTube video of her at the age of 17 . First bullied as a child in school for looking different, she was horrified to stumble across a YouTube video labeling her 'The World's Ugliest Woman' as a teenager. The video, viewed four million times, was accompanied by a cascade of cruel comments about her appearance - and suggestions that she should have killed at birth. 'It was afternoon. I decided to go look for music on YouTube - and that's when I found it,' she said. 'I don't even know why I clicked on it but I did and that's when I lost it. Speaking ahead of her documentary's showing today, Lizzie said: 'I'm so excited, I can't even tell you' 'Calling me a monster or asking why my parents didn't abort me... how in the world can I forgive the people who told me to kill myself?' She fought back by giving a TED Talk in 2013 which she says 'changed everything'. 'This is my purpose. This is what I'm meant to do for the rest of my life. 'I like to think that I'm not only telling my story, I'm telling everyone's story.' Now, Lizzie's own YouTube channel, which boasts more than 300,000 subscribers. Speaking in a video posted to her channel ahead of her documentary's showing today, she said: 'I'm so excited, I can't even tell you. 'I finally was able to sleep and I'm feeling rested and ready to go.' But the inspiring 26-year-old fought back by becoming a motivational speaker and anti-bullying activist . Director Sara Hirsh Bordo said: 'Bullying is a subject that historically yields heartbreaking stories of hopelessness and in many times, loss. 'Rarely is there a story of survival and inspiration that continues to crossover ages, genders, and ethnicities… enter the brave story of Lizzie Velasquez.' The pair met when Ms Bordo asked her to give the TED Talk, which attracted more than 10million viewers. 'She was a local hero whose time, we found out shortly after, had arrived,' she added. 'We live in a culture of tremendous meanness. And few people have experienced it more than Lizzie. 'Lizzie chose to not give up, but to forgive and to thrive; as an author, as a speaker, and now as an activist.' She added: 'What I wanted to show is that this is Lizzie’s film, but it is everyone’s story.' Marfan Syndrome is a rare genetic disorder that affects the body’s connective tissue, which hold the body’s cells and organs together. Connective tissue also plays an important role in helping the body grow and develop properly. Marfan affects about one in 5,000 people - and can affect men and women of all races and ethnic groups. Three-quarters of those who have it inherit it - and there is a 50% chance that someone with Marfan syndrome will pass along the genetic mutation each time they have a child. But some are the first in their family to have it, which is called spontaneous mutation when it happens. People with Marfan syndrome are born with it, but features of the disorder are not always present immediately. Some features of Marfan syndrome, including those affecting the heart and blood vessels, bones or joints, can get worse over time. This means it is important for early diagnosis and treatment in order to avoid the risk for potentially life-threatening complications.

Nationwide guidelines prevent childcare centres from rinsing or washing clothing, so if a child has an accident, their pants the underwear must be bagged and labelled and left in a communal bucket for parents to take home at the end of the day. Leah Spender, 34, said that she was presented with her son Ethan's underwear after being informed that the staff were not allowed to touch faecal matter. Scroll down for video . Leah Spender, 34, (above) said that she was presented with her son Ethan's underwear at the end of the day that still had a poo inside . 'I had no idea that this was common practice. When your child is learning to ""potty train"" the Childcare providers ask that you bring in a spare pair of undies and shorts... but that was all I was told,' Ms Spender told Daily Mail Australia. 'The first time I was given my ""goody bag"" the day care mum said ""Oh! Before I forget! Ethan has a present for you.."" she walked to the toilet area and fished out a a grey plastic shopping bag, which was tied in a knot at the top and handed it to me. I could see the words ""Ethan W"" written on the bag and a date,' she said. Ms Spender said that she was shocked that centres would send home a 'full piece of poo'. 'Dirty underwear is one thing, but wrapping the entire thing up, for you to then put in your handbag, walk down the street to your car.. and drive the whole way home with a full piece in the bag.. that's a bit far,' she said. Cristal Jamieson, from Brisbane, took to Facebook to express her frustration over the practice, after she had repeatedly asked her daughter's childcare centre to throw out the soiled underwear rather than send it home. The final straw came when she opened a three-day old bag with her daughter's name on it. Ms Jamieson posted on media personality Em Rusciano's official Facebook page, asking for advice on how to handle the situation. 'Today, I got greeted with a plastic bag with an entire turd wrapped in princess pink undies with 'Ellie 16/03' written on,' she wrote. 'Yes my daughter is named Ellie but surely this isn't her complete turd packaged from 3 days prior after sitting in communal 'turd' bucket for 3 days!!! Surely...Can I please ask, what would have Em done? Please….' Rusciano brought attention of her 100,000 followers to the issue, and said she 'would have lost my mind.' '[I would have] taken the unfortunate doggy bag, found that person's car and placed the poo in a spot they would never find and just let the smell haunt them until they had to set their car on fire.' Outraged parents were quick to comment, with many adding that their childcare centre had a similar practice of sending home packaged poo. 'I have had such a turd greet me, but the day care centre in question were kind enough to distribute each individual turd in their little plastic bags into the respective child's backpack. Revolting, & thrown straight in the bin - because what else can you do with that kind of s**t?' posted one parent. Em Rusciano brought attention of her 100,000 followers to the issue of sending poo home with children . Media personality Rusciano said she 'would have lost my mind' had she been presented with a 'package' Outraged parents were quick to comment, with many adding that their childcare centre had a similar practice of sending home packaged poo . 'This has happened to us!! But didn't know the s**t was in there until it fell on my laundry bench when I opened up the bag!' said another. While some on the post who claimed to be childcare workers expressed disgust at the practice, others pointed to national guidelines which enforced the activity. Recommendations from the National Health and Medical Research Council’s 'Staying Healthy: Preventing infectious diseases in early childhood education and care services' guidelines released in 2012, childcare centres are advised to 'place any soiled clothes in a plastic bag or alternative, so parents can take their child’s clothes home'. While the guidelines are not legislated, some childcare centres around Australia choose to accept the recommendations, and enforce the practice of sending home soiled underwear as part of the centre's blanket policy. Some on the post who claimed to be childcare workers expressed disgust at the practice . Cristal Jamieson, a mother from Brisbane, would like to see a blanket rule that if the centres cannot remove the poo, they throw out the underwear . Childcare centres are advised by the National Health and Medical Research Council to 'place any soiled clothes in a plastic bag or alternative, so parents can take their child’s clothes home' Ms Jamieson said that she has made a formal complaint with the Queensland Department of Child Services . A spokesperson from the Education and Care Services National Regulations said that education and care services are required to 'ensure adequate health and hygiene practices' and 'have laundry facilities or access to laundry facilities; or other arrangements for dealing with soiled clothing'. 'As the regulations do not prescribe what practices are considered adequate, service providers make their own decisions about what health and hygiene practices are used at the service, informed by relevant guidelines and best practice,' the spokesperson said. After communicating with her child care centre, Ms Jamieson said that she has made a formal complaint with the Queensland Department of Child Services, and said she is horrified that the practice is so widespread. 'This is political correctness gone mad, policies need to be changed,' she told Daily Mail Australia. While the NHMRC's guidelines are not legislated, some childcare centres around Australia choose to accept the recommendations . 'The centre said it was against their guidelines to do much more than package it up. I asked for them to throw the underwear out but staff changes mean that not everyone knows and that my daughter's poo keeps being sent home.' Ms Jamieson said that she was worried that the hot bathroom where the soiled bags are kept would negatively impact on the toilet training of the children. 'This is a very critical time, developmentally, for young children, and the environment it meant to be pleasant. The room is disgusting, it smells, and this is not creating an efficient, rewarding experience.' Ms Jamieson would like to see a blanket rule that if the centres cannot remove the poo, they throw out the underwear, and said that the practice is humiliating for children. 'It's like a child isn't deserving of the same respect that adults get. Imagine having to take your bag home with poo inside it, it's degrading,' she said.

a7a25c371af0e809b91f004e5ab388fc7bcf33f9,"Ukip leader Nigel Farage said an Indian NHS doctor almost killed him by failing to diagnose his cancer . Nigel Farage has launched an astonishing attack on the National Health Service accusing doctors of 'incompetence and negligence' over their failure to diagnose his cancer. The controversial politician developed cancer in his 20s and said an Indian doctor tried to convince him he had an infection even though his left testicle had swollen to the size of a rock hard lemon. The Ukip leader claimed he was 'fobbed off by one NHS doctor to the next', and, without private health insurance, he would 'probably be dead'. Writing in his memoir, The Purple Revolution, which is being serialised in the Telegraph, Farage wrote: 'Several doctors examined me - registrars, locums, all that lot - and they came to the conclusion that I had a twisted testicle. I would need an immediate operation, they said. I was taken by ambulance to hospital in Farnborough, Hampshire, where I was re-examined by another four doctors. It was pretty painful. 'An Indian doctor told me that the Bromley doctors had got it all wrong: I had an infection. I was to go home and take a heavy dose of antibiotics. I did not need an operation after all. A few weeks went by and the pain was just as bad. All the time, my left testicle was getting markedly larger.' Mr Farage said that six weeks later he was having difficulty walking and his 'left testicle was as large as a lemon and rock hard'. But despite being in a 'terrible state' a consultant directed him to ''keep taking the antibiotics' and sent him away. Eventually Mr Farage said he sought an opinion from a private consultant who diagnosed cancer. Scroll down for video . After being told he was covered by company health insurance he went for private treatment and was swiftly informed he had a tumour and would need to have a testicle removed. Mr Farage told how he was 'terrified' when doctors told him he may have secondary tumours in his stomach and lungs. More than 30 years on, recounting the period 'makes  me upset', he added. On the day of the 2010 general election, Mr Farage said a plane crash during a publicity stunt and an earlier car crash has left him with the body of a 70-year-old.d. Mr Farage, pictured, revealed that one of his testicles had swollen up to the size of  large rock hard lemon . Mr Farage, pictured after a plane crash on election day in 2010 admitted the NHS was good in emergencies . After the air accident Mr Farage was told that he could be  signed off as partially  disabled but having a blue badge would be ' conceding  defeat'. ' I remember thinking, 'so this is it, this is how it ends',' he said of the air crash. 'When people say that their life flashed before them when they thought they were about to die, it is rubbish. 'All I could think of was how much there was I still wanted to do and the impact my death would have on others - my girls were still so little and the boys were only just finding their way in the world.' He added: ' Having nearly died three times has made me a much bigger risk-taker. When you think your life is about to be taken away and you are given it back, you just want to get on and do things. 'There's no time to waste: children to bring up, elections to win, pheasants to pluck, wine to drink.' The Ukip leader accused other political parties of being afraid of criticising the NHS . He has also taken the opportunity in his memoir to attack the other major Westminster political parties over their fear of criticising the NHS. He said that he is 'better qualified to criticise and defend our health care system than most politicians'. Mr Farage praised the NHS for being 'astonishingly good' at emergency critical care but claims the NHS will 'probably let you down' over screening and a fast diagnosis. He said the system is 'so over-stretched that if you can afford private health care, you should take it' and warned that the NHS ' is so battered and poorly run that unless you are really lucky, you will fall through the cracks'. 'There are huge problems with the NHS, deep structural ones, but, as I have said, I know more than most what that means on a personal level,' he wrote. 'When I had cancer, the incompetence and negligence of the NHS almost killed me, but it has also saved my life. I am certainly not taking any flak from gutless politicians who claim that I am no fan or supporter of the NHS.'","Nigel Farage has revealed he had testicular cancer at the age of 21 .

But when it comes to wearing kilts, it seems the Scots are being outdone by their English counterparts these days. New figures suggest more kilts are being rented south of the border than they are north – with English hires totalling almost double those of the Scots. New figures suggest more kilts, loved by the Royal family, are being rented south of the border than they are north – with English hires totalling almost double those of the Scots . Of the 7,646 kilt hires made, most kilts were hired out in London, where the company conducted a fifth of its Highland trade . According to Young’s Hire, the largest formalwear hire company in the UK, only 2,645 Scots took out the attire last year- in comparison with 5,000 English. And of the 7,646 kilt hires made, most kilts were hired out in London, where the company conducted a fifth of its Highland trade. Elsewhere in the UK, 12 per cent of its kilts were hired in Leicester, 10 per cent in Manchester, 10 per cent in Sheffield and 6 per cent in Liverpool. Only 9 per cent of all kilts hired went to enthusiasts in Dundee, and Aberdeen accounted for just two percent of the highland wear hires. Industry insiders said in the wake of Scotland’s vote against independence earlier this year, it seems Hogmanay is becoming ever more popular in other parts of the UK. The researchers analysed more than 400,000 garment hires during the last 12 months, focussing on kilts rented for Christmas parties, New Year’s celebrations, winter weddings and other formal occasions. The researchers analysed more than 400,000 garment hires during the last 12 months, focussing on kilts rented for Christmas parties, New Year’s celebrations, winter weddings and other formal occasions . Chris Burns, at Young’s Hire, said: ‘It’s always fascinating to take a more holistic look at the formalwear trends around the UK. ‘It’s great that traditional Scottish highland wear is still going strong and is growing in popularity across England.’ The most popular kilt was the Grey Granite, a conservative dark tartan design which accounted for 30 per cent of total rentals. The more colourful Pride of Scotland print was a close second with 23 per cent, followed by the Help for Heroes Kilt with 10 per cent. The kilt is thought to have originated in the 16th Century, but some historians have claimed it was Thomas Rawlinson, a Quaker from Lancashire, who first popularised the look in the 18th Century. Industry insiders said in the wake of Scotland’s vote against independence earlier this year, it seems Hogmanay is becoming ever more popular in other parts of the UK . The original kilt was an all-over body covering known as the feileadh mhór or ‘big wrap’, but later evolved into something like what is worn today. The research also showed that the traditional ‘top hat and tails’ was keeping its popularity in the South East for formal occasions. London accounted for more than 10 per cent of the traditional wedding garb, while Essex accounted for 6 per cent and Berkshire 5 per cent. Northern cities on the other hand, tended to avoid the outfit, with Newcastle accounting for a measly 0.014 per cent of all top hat rentals. Also choosing to err against traditional top hat and tails get up were the people of Manchester, who rented 1 per cent, and Leeds which rented 2 per cent. Young’s Hire has more than 195 locations across the UK, with concessions in stores including Debenhams, Suit Direct and Jeff Banks.","When it comes to kilts, Scots are being outdone by  English counterparts .

2ea8a0c00a38c06bb8e0c4cd99876445ef1f1641,"SO YOU'VE BEEN PUBLICLY SHAMED . by Jon Ronson . (Picador £16.99) Shame stalks the land. It wakes us up at three in the morning. It inhabits the most secret corners of our lives. It’s a complete waste of time and energy, but for many of us it’s a lifetime’s work to get shot of it. I think I’ve lost most of mine, but I still have a little spare if you’re running short. At the same time, the real villains of the piece, the people who really should feel shame for what they have done and continue to do, feel none at all. Jimmy Savile was shameless. I know a few bankers, and I don’t know one who feels anything but delight that he and his kind have got away with it. So this is an important subject, and a fascinating one. Two new books consider shame from different points of view. Jon Ronson is a journalist and broadcaster who has built up something of a reputation writing about extremely odd people. For this book, however, he has spoken to normal people who found themselves in distinctly abnormal situations. For these are people who have been shamed, publicly, humiliatingly, horribly. Sometimes what they have done is pretty bad; sometimes what they have done is nothing much at all. But in each case, the judgment of the mob has been merciless. In his book, Jon Ronson insists that there is potential in everyone for this merciless judgment (stock image) Take the case of Justine Sacco, a young New York PR who tweeted this: ‘Going to Africa. Hope I don’t get Aids. Just kidding. I’m white!’ As jokes go, it’s definitely at the bad taste end of the spectrum, and it’s not one I’d make. But the point is: it was a joke. One of Justine’s 130 followers on Twitter retweeted this, then others re-re-retweeted it. When she landed at Cape Town airport, there was a text from her best friend. ‘You need to call me immediately. You’re the number one worldwide trend on Twitter right now.’ The abuse was astonishing. ‘All I want for Christmas is to see @Justine Sacco’s face when her plane lands and she checks her inbox/voicemail.’ ‘We are about to watch this @Justine Sacco b**** get fired. In REAL time. Before she even KNOWS she’s getting fired.’ And worse, much much worse. A man was waiting at the airport, took a photo of her and posted it online. Newspapers ran stories on her. She had to cut short her holiday because hotel staff were threatening to go on strike if she showed up. She was fired from her job and no one else would hire her to do anything. Her life was ruined over a bad joke. Ronson tells this terrible story in his deadpan way, his sympathies clearly with the victim. But he admits that he too has been part of a Twitter mob monstering some poor fool who had done something he didn’t approve of. This is what public shaming amounts to these days. Justice, says Ronson, has been democratised. Not all of his interviewees are so sympathetic. Take the case of Jonah Lehrer, the sharp young American hack who made up one too many quotes and was shamed into unemployment. Given the opportunity to apologise at a conference, he found that the hosts had erected a huge screen with a live Twitter feed behind his head. ‘I am not feeling terribly convinced by the deadpan mea culpa droning on by @jonahlehrer.’ ‘I can’t handle watching the @jonahlehrer apology. He is boring and unconvincing. Time for something else.’ While he was making his speech! Why not just put him in the stocks and throw rotten tomatoes at him? What this all amounts to, of course, is bullying. Worse: self-righteous, vindictive bullying. Jon Ronson’s book isn’t always the easiest read, although his characteristic wit and wonderful, sinuous way of telling a story guide you effortlessly through the horrors within its pages. He is also insistent that the potential for such behaviour is in us all. And while you’re thinking ‘No, not me’, he tells you a story that so incenses you that you can imagine taking action against the malefactor yourself. He is a clever man and this is a magnificent book, subtly argued, often painfully funny and yet deeply serious, and absolutely of the moment. I’m not sure I can recommend it highly enough. IS SHAME NECESSARY? by Jennifer Jacquet . (Allen Lane £17.99) For Jennifer Jacquet, shame is not so much a scourge as ‘a tool that we can put to use to help solve serious problems’. This young American environmentalist wishes to make corporations behave better. If we are to save the planet, then just buying dolphin-friendly tuna and energy-saving lightbulbs isn’t going to do it. No, we have to shame companies into doing what we want them to. We can do this in much the same way that Ronson’s trolls have. Shame is ‘more salient to public life than ever before, since the power to use it has been wrested away from opinion leaders and the state and put increasingly in the hands of citizens’. Jacquet can’t write for toffee, but her manifesto for change deserves our respect. I still prefer Ronson’s book, though, which sits uncomfortably in the memory, like something you did long ago, and really wish you hadn’t.","Jon Ronson has a reputation for writing about extremely odd people .

Despite consistently dismal poll ratings, the Lib Dem leader claimed it would win more seats than forecast and could still hold office with fewer MPs. Attacking his Conservative coalition partners, he compared David Cameron to 'Nigel Farage in a white tie' and declared: 'Cows moo, dogs bark – and Tories cut. It's in their DNA.' Scroll down for video . Liberal Democrats leader Nick Clegg salutes the audience after speaking at a party conference in Liverpool . Mr Clegg claims his party could stop a 'rag-tag mob' of MPs from Ukip or the Scottish National Party from holding the balance of power after the election on May 7 . Nick Clegg hugs his wife Miriam Gonzalez Durantez, a partner at a US law firm, after his speech in Liverpool . Mr Clegg also criticised Labour, despite making it clear he could foresee a coalition with either of the major parties. But he ruled out a formal coalition deal involving the SNP or Ukip. He went so far as to claim that only his party could stop a 'rag-tag mob' of MPs from Ukip or the Scottish National Party from holding the balance of power after the election on May 7. The latest polls have consistently put the Lib Dems on just 7 per cent, with experts predicting they will lose at least half the 57 seats they won at the last election. But, bizarrely, Mr Clegg compared their hopes for the future to last November's landing of the Rosetta space probe on the surface of a comet. 'What an audacious, optimistic thing to have ever dreamt of attempting,' he said. Speaking at the party's spring conference in Liverpool, he added: 'I want us to take just a little bit of the spirit of that audacious project and to think big.' Mr Clegg, who appeared to have matched his pink tie with the bubblegum-pink dress worn by his wife Miriam, watching from the front row, said his party would 'defy the odds and win this May'. He added: 'I have a message for all those who are writing us off again: The Liberal Democrats are here to stay. I've heard the predictions, I've seen the polls. But let me tell you this: We will do so much better than anyone thinks.' However, his upbeat speech was overshadowed by an attack from Left-winger Tim Farron, who is thought to want his job. Mr Farron, the Lib Dems' former president, said a second coalition with the Tories would tarnish the party's reputation 'over the next generation'. He said he would give the party just two out of ten for its handling of coalition government. Mr Clegg, who appeared to have matched his pink tie with the bubblegum-pink dress worn by his wife Miriam, watching from the front row, said his party would 'defy the odds and win this May' Wife Miriam Gonzalez Durantez and Women's minister Jo Swinson listen to the keynote speech in Liverpool . The Deputy Prime Minister said: 'I have a message for all those who are writing us off again: The Liberal Democrats are here to stay' Former leader Paddy Ashdown was unable to suppress a yawn as he watched Mr Clegg deliver his speech . But former leader Paddy Ashdown said yesterday that Mr Farron should keep his ambitions in check. Lord Ashdown, who struggled to stifle a yawn during the conference, said of Mr Farron: 'I think his well-known ambitions would be better served with a little more patience and a little more judgment. 'Tim is a very able guy but judgment is not his strong suit.' Lib Dem insiders firmly believe the party could be back in ministerial posts even if they emerge with as few as 30 seats on May 8. They expect the Tories to emerge as the largest party, and hope they will be within 30 seats of a majority – 326 seats – so the Lib Dems can prop them up. Mr Clegg's 46-year-old wife – a partner at a US law firm – does not get on stage to embrace her husband as other political wives do after their speeches. Yesterday, it was Mr Clegg who came down the steps – as at previous conferences – and hugged her before they left to cheers from the party faithful.","Mr Clegg claims Lib Dems will will more seats than forecast in May election .

d3833d4eef7048a5fb1376902df8f63a2eadcbe1,"The Prime Minister will condemn 'warped' sense of political correctness which prevented council staff from reporting abuse for fear of appearing racist . Teachers, social workers and councillors who turn a blind eye to child sex abuse will face up to five years in jail under plans for a new criminal offence. It comes as David Cameron today vows to eradicate the ‘culture of denial’ surrounding the issue. The Government has decided to act following an official report that found at least 1,400 children were subjected to appalling sexual abuse in Rotherham between 1997 and 2013. Children as young as 11 were raped by multiple perpetrators, abducted and trafficked to other cities in England. The Prime Minister will say a ‘warped’ sense of political correctness contributed to local authorities not acting. The inquiry found there were fears among council staff of being labelled racist if they focused on victims’ descriptions of the majority of abusers as Asian men. There have been separate allegations of decades of paedophile activity by powerful individuals in churches, hospitals, schools, political parties and the BBC. New measures will be unveiled at a summit in Downing Street attended by victims and survivors’ groups, police chiefs, council leaders, health and social care professionals, and child protection experts. Ministers plan to introduce a new criminal offence of ‘wilful neglect’ of children suffering abuse, and apply it to social workers, teachers and elected council members. A similar offence has recently been introduced in the health service and is punishable by up to five years in jail or an unlimited fine, and unlimited fines for organisations. As well as new sanctions for public sector workers who fail to protect children, the Government will announce a new national helpline for professionals to blow the whistle on bad practice. Child sex abuse is also to be prioritised as a ‘national threat’ by police and crime commissioners and chief constables. The Prime Minister will say: ‘We have all been appalled at the abuse suffered by so many young girls in Rotherham and elsewhere across the country. ‘Children were ignored, sometimes even blamed, and issues were swept under the carpet – often because of a warped and misguided sense of political correctness. 'That culture of denial which let them down so badly must be eradicated. Shaun Right, the former  Police and Crime Commissioner of South Yorkshire, resigned over the scandal . 'Today, I am sending an unequivocal message that professionals who fail to protect children will be held properly accountable and council bosses who preside over such catastrophic failure will not see rewards for that failure. ‘But it is not just about introducing new policies. It is about making sure that the professionals we charge with protecting our children – the council staff, police officer and social workers – do the jobs they are paid to do.’ The new offence of wilful neglect will apply when there has been a failure to act when a court concludes that a ‘moral duty’ to do so exists. It is expected to sit alongside a separate ‘mandatory reporting’ law, which would apply in schools, hospitals, churches, or sports clubs operated by a national body. Similar laws already exist in Northern Ireland, Australia, the United States and Denmark which impose a legal duty on professionals such as teachers, social workers, police and doctors to report suspicions of abuse or face legal consequences.","Government decided to act following revelations of Rotherham scandal .

In a revealing interview on BBC One, the politician admitted his family had paid the price for his position as the head of the United Kingdom Independence Party. Once described as 'the most hated man in Britain', an emotional Farage appeared to break down in tears he said how his children were being judged 'unfairly'. Ukip leader Nigel Farage broke down in tears as he described how his children had been bullied . 'We have this very unusual surname, there aren't many of us, and that is difficult, it is difficult,' said the MEP who has two children under the age of 15 and another two in their 20s, . 'It is difficult when you are younger because you are going to get teased mercilessly wherever you go, but it actually difficult when you are grown up too, because people are judging you unfairly by your father, and that's tough, that is tough.' But he said his family's struggle would not make him give up the chance to establish Ukip as a party with real political sway. 'I've got to go with it and to hell with the consequences,' he added. It appears his ambition is paying off as Ukip are predicted to win six seats in the general election. Farage himself had unsuccessfully contested British parliamentary elections for UKIP five times, both before and after his election as an MEP. In August 2014 he was selected as the UKIP candidate for South Thanet in this year's general election. He was recently questioned on his 'most hated' title during an appeareance on Loose Women. In a revealing interview on BBC One, the politician admitted his family had paid the price for his position as the head of the United Kingdom Independence Party . Mr Farage said his family's struggle would not make him give up the chance to establish Ukip as a party with real political sway. His wife Kirsten is pictured left . Actress Linda Robson, one of the show’s panellists, asked Mr Farage why he had been voted ‘the most hated man in Britain’. He said: 'You look at these political figures, they are all like cardboard cut-outs. They are all playing safe, they are all scared of the media. I’m not, I’m a bit like Marmite. People either like me or don’t like me.’ He added that all politicians are fundamentally ‘selfish’ and neglect their families. He said: ‘The other three big leaders are very good at coming on programmes like this and saying what wonderful family men they are, how they do the school run and when the babies were little they changed all the nappies and did the night feeds. Maybe that’s true. All I can say is, it’s pretty much impossible to do that.’ Often pictured down the pub pint in hand, Farage also admitted he also had a secret nocturnal habit- shore fishing. The party leader said he would often travel down to the coast from London and have three or four hours of fishing through to the early hours after a busy day.","Nigel Farage broke down in tears as he described children being bullied .

However, the Leipzig String Quartet say 42-year-old Stefan Arzberger was actually the real victim, claiming he was drugged while drinking at the hotel bar. Arzberger was first caught walking around the Hudson Hotel 'completely naked' on Friday morning, according to law enforcement officials who spoke with the New York Post. Scroll down for video . Deranged: German violinist Stefan Arzberger (left) was arrested Friday, after choking a stranger at the Hudson Hotel (right)in New York City while completely naked . Defended: The 42-year-old is the lead violinist of the Leipzig String Quartet (pictured left). The group has defended Arzberger to claim that he was drugged at the hotel bar . Around 8am, he knocked on the door of a 64-year-old tourist from North Carolina, who answered. 'He stuck his arm out, and she tried to slam the door shut, but he stuck his arm in between the door and the door jamb,' the source said. 'He barged inside and grabbed her around the neck with both hands and started strangling her.' Arzberger allegedly choked the woman  - who was a complete stranger - so bad that blood vessels in her eyes ruptured. A hotel worker who heard the poor woman's screams ran to her aid and pulled the deranged Arzberger off of her. The NYPD arrested Arzberger on charges of strangulation and burglary. He was released on $100,000 bail on Saturday, and his lawyer says he has no criminal record. Out on bail: NYPD arrested Arzberger on charges of strangulation and burglary. He was released on $100,000 bail on Saturday, and his lawyer says he has no criminal record . 'He’s an upstanding member of society without a criminal record who has devoted his life to the arts,' lawyer Nicholas Kaizer told The Post. 'He has no record anywhere, and we hope at the end of the journey, he has no record here.' The quartet was also quick to defend their leading member. In a statement, the group claimed that Arzberger may have been slipped a drug the night before while drinking at the hotel bar since he remembers nothing of his crazed attack. 'We have to announce that Stefan became on Sat. 26th victim of a serious crime in New York City. Things are in clearance now. At this time the lawyers do not allow to divulge more information. We feel great solidarity and hope for a sudden end of that nightmare! Stefan, we are with you!' the statement reads.

But one pensioner took a slightly more unorthodox approach after splitting from his wife by nailing a caravan on top of a motorised catamaran and sailing it around the English coast. The unusual vehicle, which also features a rather flimsy looking safety fence, was last spotted making its way along The Swale between the Isle of Sheppey and Kent coast. Unusual sight: The pensioner has now taken to the water in a floating caravan, seen in recent days chugging along down The Swale between the Isle of Sheppey and Kent coast . Puzzled locals, who have watched the bizarre contraption in disbelief, said the owner is a keen boatman in his '70s or 80s’ and lives in nearby Sittingbourne. Some residents had theorized that the man built the craft to appease his wife, who was said to hate sailing but love caravaning. However a close friend of the handyman said that the couple actually split two years ago, and his friend built the craft as a way of coping with his grief. ‘And fisherman Trevor Ryan, 63, added: ‘He bought the catamaran and then he fitted the caravan on it and launched it from Iron Wharf boatyard. Close-up: The caravan has been fixed to the base of a catamaran fitted with a small engine - and while there is a flimsy-looking fence around the vehicle, there are no other obvious safety measures . ‘He is about 70 or 80 years old and he has got a few yachts and boats in the harbour but for some reason he has obviously built this caravan. I don't know why he has done it. 'But he loves the water and maybe he saw it as a bit of an escape where he could get away and watch the world go by.’ The Swale is a 13-mile channel that separates Sheppey from the north Kent mainland, and can be crossed by two bridges.","Caravan seen along The Swale between Isle of Sheppey and Kent coast .

The Bundesliga side want to keep the Belgium international for at least one more season as they plan a crack at the Champions League next year. However, City, Bayern Munich and Paris St Germain are all interested in signing him this summer. Manchester City are pressing ahead with a deal for Wolfsburg playmaker Kevin de Bruyne . De Bruyne has been in fine form for club and country this season and is rated at £40m . De Bruyne celebrates with Marouane Fellaini (c) and Radja Nainggolan after a goal against Cyprus . De Bruyne’s agent Patrick de Koster has hinted it would take a bid close to £40million for Wolfsburg to consider selling. Talking last week he said: ‘Clubs who are ready to bid 30million euros for Kevin have no sense of reality. A player like Kevin has a market value of some €50million, €55m or even €60m by now.’ De Bruyne, 23, cost Wolfsburg £16.7m when he signed in January 2014 from Chelsea and has scored 14 goals for his club this season. City defender Aleksandar Kolarov has admitted he’s tempted by a return to Italy after starting just 11 Premier League games this season. The 29-year-old Serb, who cost £16m from Lazio in 2010, fuelled the speculation while praising the job compatriot Sinisa Mihajlovic has done as manager of third-placed Sampdoria.

074b95d9fc9d1a9a434f6b9bdda7aafb9ac8a701,"The BBC was last night accused of suppressing an interview that called for corporation boss Rona Fairhead to resign over her £10,000-a-day second job at scandal-hit HSBC bank. It’s a new blow to Mrs Fairhead, chairman of the BBC Trust and a non-executive director of HSBC, who is facing growing calls to quit one of her high-profile jobs over claims of a conflict of interest. She is due to be questioned by MPs tomorrow after The Mail on Sunday revealed that she was paid £513,000 for just 50 days work at the troubled bank last year, vastly exceeding her £110,000 salary for what is supposed to be her main job overseeing the BBC. Last month HSBC came under fire over allegations that its Swiss banking arm helped wealthy clients dodge millions of pounds of British taxes, and that it sought to influence media coverage. Silenced: Retired businessman Michael Mason-Mahon (right) who said Rona Fairhead was not a fit and proper person to be chairwoman of the BBC Trust, will not be shown . Now an HSBC shareholder has claimed the BBC refused to broadcast an interview with him in which he declared that Mrs Fairhead was not a fit and proper person to be heading the Trust. Retired businessman Michael Mason-Mahon says he was invited to Broadcasting House in Central London to discuss the turmoil at HSBC in an on-the-record interview with a BBC business reporter on February 23. His interview failed to feature in the broadcaster’s coverage of the HSBC story that evening. He believes it was shelved because of his remarks questioning Mrs Fairhead’s fitness to run the Trust. He said: ‘I said during the interview I disagreed with her appointment as BBC Trust chairwoman. ‘I couldn’t understand why a non-executive director who is there to protect the shareholders ignored us when we told her on numerous occasions in the past about illegal behaviour that was going on involving HSBC. ‘It’s my personal belief she’s not a fit and proper person to be chairwoman of the BBC Trust. The HSBC item was shown, but my interview was not in it. I believe it may have been suppressed.’ Mr Mason-Mahon has attempted to obtain a copy of the interview but has been told that this would be against BBC policy. Mr Mason-Mahon is well-known for his outbursts at the annual general meetings of big public companies. Last May he brought a lawsuit against HSBC’s North American arm after it was fined £1.2 billion having been found guilty in 2012 of allowing Mexican drug cartels to launder money. Last week former BBC chairman Sir Christopher Bland called on Mrs Fairhead either to give up her post at HSBC or to resign from the Trust. Tomorrow she is due to appear in her role as an HSBC Board member in front of the Commons public accounts committee, which has fiercely attacked tax-dodging corporations. Last night the BBC declined to say why the interview with Mr Mason-Mahon was not broadcast and whether or not Mrs Fairhead – who is not supposed to be involved in editorial decisions – was told about it. A spokesman pointed out that it was the BBC’s Panorama programme that originally broadcast the highly damaging allegations about HSBC’s Swiss banking arm and added: ‘Like every news organisation we don’t use every interview we conduct. 'It is simply wrong to suggest that we would not broadcast an interview due to it criticising someone associated with the BBC.’","Called for Rona Fairhead to resign over £10,000-a-day second job .

eb6db83759b039c97b917db592749d16799254b7,"Typical Paul O'Connell. Ireland are chasing down a possible second Grand Slam in six years and, instead of the narrative being exclusively about how Joe Schmidt's side will fare in jumping hurdle number four at the Millennium Stadium on Saturday, the skipper's 100th cap for his country is providing a smokescreen for teammates glad of a diversionary topic. O'Connell wouldn't be of a mind to mention his milestone within camp himself. But still, as a topic for his comrades to pass the time with during short media sessions, it falls into perfect, anything-but-Wales, territory. Take Devin Toner, the Leinster giant who has become O'Connell's regular second-row sidekick over the past few seasons. Paul O'Connell is preparing for his 100th cap for his country at the Millenium Stadium on Saturday . Joe Schmidt are chasing down a possible second Grand Slam in six years at the Millenium Stadium . Ask about the general mechanics of the Irish lineout and the response is brief. 'I don't want to give anything away about lineout strategies,' he says. Enquire about the centurion, though, and there's, eventually, much greater pep to his patter. 'There's not much more to be said that hasn't already been said about Paulie. He's a world-class player and I don't think I'd be the player I am today without having played with him. 'I've learned so much from all the second rows I've played with, especially Leo Cullen and Paul. He's a massive leader in the squad, just a massive player on the pitch and players look up to him,' says Toner, who admits to closely watching O'Connell's ruck clear-outs as something he'd like to replicate. O'Connell gets angry during the Ireland training session at Kingspan Stadium  in Belfast, Northern Ireland . 'Just to get to 100 caps is a huge testament to how he has looked after himself and to play at the top level for that long (since his debut against Wales in 2002) is unbelievable. 'It was more intimidating playing against him for the first time because I didn't really fancy it to be honest,' continues Toner, adding that this provincial level fear has eroded now that they are Test colleagues. 'He wouldn't be in my head now… but he's kind of like Joe (Schmidt) in that you need to know your detail or he gets on top of you. That's a hugely good thing. 'More players should be doing it. He has driven standards along with Joe… the two of them just drive the squad. You don't want to disappoint either of them.' Mike Ross is another not shy about chipping in his tuppence-worth about the Ireland captain who lifted the Six Nations trophy in Paris last year. James Haskell  on the loose ball ahead of Devin Toner and Jordi Murphy  during the RBS Six Nations . O'Connell looks on after his teams victory during the RBS Six Nations match between Ireland and England . 'He has always led from the front. He might look a bit mad from the sidelines but he has always got this calm head. If things are going south, Paulie is a good man to bring everything back under check,' says the veteran tighthead about his fellow 35-year-old. 'When he was playing for Young Munster, I was over in Fermoy playing Junior Two or something like that. The first time I came into contact with him was at a Munster Under 20s training session. He has always stood out,' recalls Ross. 'I remember watching him take the park for a pre-season friendly, coming on for Mick O'Driscoll. He was an impressive physical specimen even then. 'Then he makes his debut against Wales and scores a try that he doesn't remember (due to concussion). Ireland captain O'Connell during the Ireland training session at Kingspan Stadium in Belfast, Northern Ireland . 'He has always made an impression whenever he gets the chance. It's a testament to the career he has had and the esteem in which he is held that he will now get his 100th cap. 'He's always looking for more at training sessions. 'He was questioning me this week on what bind feels best in a particular scrum. Even now he's still looking for new things.' The O'Connell theme done and dusted, it's on to the more serious business at hand - successfully defending the championship. This time last year, Ireland were picking up the pieces following their lost Triple Crown match at Twickenham which left them gunning for just the Six Nations title. Italy's prop Martin Castrogiovanni  is tackled by  Toner during the Six Nations clash at the Olympic Stadium . However, while they now still have everything to play for after three championship wins stretched their overall unbeaten run to a record equalling 10 matches, Toner doesn't feel there is a different dynamic to 2015's round four preparations - even though 'Grand Slam' is the phrase on every Ireland supporter's lips. 'I don't think there is much difference. If we look at it now, it's semifinal and final time, so we are in a good place. 'It's similar to last year. If we win the two games, we win the championship and the Grand Slam,' says Toner, adding that the growing hype outside their secluded Carton House base is largely passing him by, save for last Sunday's visit to his old North Kildare stomping ground. 'I don't really read the newspaper or see much that goes on. Obviously people want to talk about it but I'm just naturally relaxed about it. It doesn't really faze me. 'I don't really get hyped up at all.'","Ireland are chasing down a possible second Grand Slam in six years .

This year, however, experts reckon she’s running two weeks behind – the evidence of which can be seen in these pictures. The good news is, all that could change this weekend as the sun comes out and temperatures leap into the 60s. Riot of colour: Chloe Palmer and baby Jayden enjoying daffodils in bloom in Bournemouth, Dorset in March 2014 . Waiting game: Jennifer Campbell-Ross and her son Archie are pictured at the same spot yesterday with the daffodils yet to flower . Bloomin' lovely: A cherry tree at Cambridge in March 2014 is pictured left while the same tree was still waiting to shine yesterday (right) Twelve months ago flowers were already in full bloom, blossom was on the trees and wildlife was coming out of hibernation. But last month’s bitter cold snap has slowed things down this year. The contrast was noticed at the Royal Horticultural Society’s garden at Wisley, Surrey. Last year the ground was already clothed in bright yellow and purple crocuses after a mild winter. This year only a few flowers poke their heads above the ground. Colin Crosbie, curator at RHS Wisley, said: ‘We think we are probably about two weeks behind where we were last year. It has been a colder winter, the soil has been cooler and it has slowed everything down. But a few days of sunshine is all it could take for it to catch up.’ Student Tina Ding is pictured enjoying a field of purple and white crocuses on a sunny spring day in Aberdeen, Scotland this time last year . Gian Pierro is pictured in the same spot in Aberdeen yesterday with far fewer crocuses on show than at the same time last year . The Woodland Trust, which monitors the first signs of spring, said wildlife is also emerging slowly this year. Their volunteers have recorded only half the number of ladybirds they saw in March 2014. The average temperature in England for December, January and February this year was 4.4C – well below last year’s 5.8C. But that could all change in the next few days. Thermometers could nudge past 17C (63F) on Saturday as a tropical mass of air arrives from the Caribbean. National Trust wildlife specialist Matthew Oates said the slower spring is positive for many species, which need time to hibernate properly before they emerge. If butterflies, and small mammals awake too early, they tend to suffer later if the weather turns cold again. The spring flowers at the Royal Horticultural Society's garden at Wisley in Surrey were already putting on an impressive display by late Februay last year . In late Febraury this year, there were fewer flowers on display on the same patch of land at the Royal Horticultural Society’s garden at Wisley, Surrey . Meanwhile, England is set to be hotter than Athens, Corfu and Istanbul this weekend as temperatures are expected to soar as high as 16C in a bumper start to spring. Temperatures are set to increase as the week goes on and eventually peak on Saturday, where parts of the country are forecast to be warmer than many Mediterranean holiday spots. Much of the country has today seen a bright and sunny day as spring finally arrived, with tomorrow expected to be a dry, but cloudier day, with temperatures rising to 12C. The fine weather will continue in the south on Friday, but Scotland will see rain in the west and gale force gusts of up to 60mph in the north west. The weekend is set to be dry, with bright spells in south and south east England, with temperatures rising to 15C and possibly 16C in sheltered spots, but the rain will continue in western Scotland. Sunday will be slightly cooler, but another dry day with a good amount of sunny spells. There may be light showers in England and Wales later in the afternoon. 'The temperatures will get warmer as the week goes on,' said Dan Williams, of the Met Office. The sun rises across the North Sea this morning at the start of a bright and mild day in South Shields . In a sign of things to come, this stunning spring sunset was last night captured over Poole Harbour in Dorset . A group punt down the River Cam in Cambridge in what is forecast to be the start of a run of spring weather . 'By Saturday we could see temperatures of 14C or 15C and maybe even 16C in a sheltered location in London or the South East.' The warm weather will coincide with breezes of 20 - 30mph but temperatures will significantly exceed the average 10C for this time of year. Meanwhile, the early bursts of spring sunshine and a mild winter have seen this year's first crop of strawberries arrive a week early. The first homegrown strawberries of 2015 will arrive in supermarkets tomorrow - days ahead of schedule. Experts say fine weather with good levels of sunshine this week on top of a generally mild winter have helped growers produce the early fruit. And with temperatures set to reach 16C this weekend, the arrival of the strawberries at Tesco stores is a clear sign that spring is around the corner. Traditionally, the earliest home grown strawberries come from either Kent, Sussex or Hampshire but this year growers in Wales have won the race to produce the first. Tesco berry buyer Harriet Turnbull said: 'This is a real coup for Wales which only began growing strawberries on a commercial scale two years ago. 'These berries, grown in the Rhymney Valley, near Cardiff, will put Wales on the UK's strawberry growing map.' Kayleigh Cottle, 29, picks the first strawberries of the year at Haygrove Nursery in Wales . Thanks to milder winters in recent years, Britain on the whole is enjoying longer fruit growing seasons . The variety of the Welsh-grown strawberries is called Driscoll's Lusa and has been selected because of its consistent, sweet taste. Thanks to milder winters recently, Britain on the whole is enjoying longer fruit growing seasons. The British strawberry season can now last for up to nine months - a whole four months longer than last decade years ago when winters were longer and harsher. Ms Turnbull added: 'The arrival of the first home grown strawberries brings about a real feel good factor - not only does it herald the start of British summer time but it is also the start of the UK produce growing season.'","Parts of Britain expected to be warmer than Athens and Istanbul this weekend with temperatures soaring to 16C .
Today was the start of a stretch of increasingly warm spring weather that is expected to peak on Saturday .

Local residents and animal rights activists have joined together to force the local police to attempt to discover the source of the gruesome fights - and try to put a halt to the brutal baiting. Some are more worried that local gangs are acting with impunity nearby and have complained about the safety of their children from those who dump the dead animals and from the rotting, disease-ridden carcasses. Gruesome: Inside this bag are the dismembered bodies of dead dogs and roosters that are turning up alongside southeast Dallas highways . 'My daughters live right here, my son,' said a man who spoke to CBS News and wished to be identified only as Michael. 'If they'll do that to a dog, what will they do to a human?' Michael said that he usually finds stray dogs lining the roadside but recently he and another animal rescuer saw someone throw bags from a pickup truck. 'It was the bags with all the dead dogs, mush, decomposed bodies, roosters, matted hair. It was hor-I mean, it stunk. You can imagine how it smelled,' said Michael to CBS. Gross: Locals fear that a gang-related animal fighting ring is dumping the dead bodies along the Dallas road . Strays: Dogs are usually left by their owners along the stretch of road - but now dead dogs are turning up - much to local residents disgust . On another day Michael found bags full of dead chickens and then sadly, more dogs. 'It was something you might see in a horror movie,' said Michael to CBS. Local residents fear an animal fighting ring and the involvement of gangs and say that police are not investigating. However, a local Dallas Police Department spokesman said that they are working with animal control to find the culprits.","Residents of southeast Dallas are finding bags filled with dismembered dogs and roosters .

A Boca Raton woman is accused of smearing dog poop on her elderly neighbor's face to get revenge following argument. Amy Goldberg is accused of putting it on her 67-year-old neighbor's face and arms last week. Goldberg, 57, was charged with battery on a person 65 years or older. The smearing suspect's neighbor was walking her dog when the animal defecated on the lawn in front of Goldberg's home at the Woodfield Country Club in Boca Raton, according to an arrest report. The neighbor said Goldberg came running out of her house screaming and yelling, the Palm Beach Post reported. When Goldberg told her to clean it up, the neighbor, who already had a plastic baggie in her hand, allegedly fired back: 'You clean it up.' Goldberg allegedly grabbed the dog's mess in a bag and hurled it at her neighbor after a chase, according to the Orlando Sentinel. Goldberg then grabbed what was left of the pooch's poop and smeared it on her neighbor's arms and face. After police arrived, Goldberg told them she threw the fido feces in her neighbor's direction, but maintained that she never touched her. The 1,300 homes in the Woodfield community cost anywhere from $300,000 up to a few million dollars . Goldberg told officers the neighbor smeared the animal waste on herself to frame her for the attack because they had a long history of bad blood. She was booked into the Palm Beach County Jail and released. If convicted, Goldberg could be sentenced to a minimum of three years in prison and be forced to pay fines of up to $10,000.

7a6bec18c4896584fc8e572962ec219e8c65cd70,"Children who spend a lot of time playing video games do better at school, an international study has suggested. The Paris-based Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development said there was strong evidence that playing computer games on handheld consoles like Nintendo DSs and Sony PSPs had 'positive effects on learning'. It said many games 'incorporate good learning principles' and can 'hone problem-solving skills'. The Paris-based Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development said there was strong evidence that playing computer games had 'positive effects on learning' Girls are more likely to get higher marks at school because teachers like them more, an international report has found. Teachers consistently give better results to girls even when they perform similarly in international tests, the Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development said. It suggests that teachers have a 'gender bias' towards girls because they are well behaved and listen in class. 'Girls' better marks may reflect the fact that they tend to be 'better students' than boys: they tend to do what is required and expected of them, thanks to better self-regulation skills, and they are more driven to excel in school,' the study says. But this may harm girls' future career prospects, the OECD suggests, because bosses  reward people based on what they  can do rather than their school grades. Students who play one-player video games between once a month and almost every day perform better in mathematics, reading, science and problem solving than students who hardly ever play games, the OECD said. But the evidence shows that playing computer games only helps children at school if they are not competing against other people over the internet. Boys are much more likely than girls to play computer games – but often get caught up in shoot 'em ups and other online competitions against other players, the study said. This means that playing on the computer at home helps girls more than boys. The report said: 'The gender gap in video gaming translates into a performance advantage for girls.' However, it also warns that the 'addictive nature of gaming' has its downsides. It said: 'Students who play video games excessively might not be able to focus on their work at school, may be less willing to spend time on school work at home, might develop sleep problems, and might be less perseverant if there are no immediate rewards for their efforts, like those offered in gaming.' Today's shock research comes after Boris Johnson claimed video games were helping children become 'nicer, kinder and more well-balanced' than their parents – and was even helping to cut crime. Students who play one-player video games between once a month and almost every day perform better in mathematics, reading, science and problem solving than students who hardly ever play games . The London Mayor ridiculed claims mobile phones and handheld games consoles were turning youngsters into 'lidless lizards'. Mr Johnson said he understood people's concerns when they saw their children 'bathed perpetually in the light of the screen gazing like lidless lizards at whatever depraved and corrupting material they can find'. But Mr Johnson said: 'I see no evidence whatever that tech is coarsening or depraving the young people of today. Boris Johnson has praised video games for making today's teenagers more sociable than their parents . 'In fact I would say that on the whole the younger generation are nicer, kinder, more well-balanced and more emotionally literate than my lot ever were.' The London Mayor added: 'And when you consider the very steep falls in crime that we are seeing not just in London but across the developed world and when you consider that crime is overwhelmingly committed by young men you have to wonder whether there is a correlation - a link between the tech boom and the rise in civility. 'What do they suffer from, the young men who are so foolish as to get sucked into crime? Anger, low self-esteem, a sense of social exclusion - a feeling that no one much cares about them. 'And what do they get from these gizmos – endless opportunities for self-expression, communication - the myriad pipette drops of self-affirmation that come with the selfie and the text and the shared video.' Today's OECD's report also warns against the growing divide between girls and boys in science and maths. It blames gender stereotypes and girls' lack of confidence for putting them off the core subjects. The report - using research from international tests in reading, maths and science to examine gender differences in education - argues that parents, teachers and employers all have ingrained 'biases' that they are passing on to youngsters. Across the 64 nations examined, women are much less likely to consider careers in science and maths-based subjects and to have the same self-confidence as boys in these areas. Overall, less than one in 20 girls considers working in science, technology, engineering and maths, compared to one in five boys, despite the sexes achieving similar results in international science tests.","OECD report finds computer games have 'positive effects on learning'

653dbc9adbead1d8364e46c334cacbd47ab92cd4,"A woman of 95 has died after waiting four hours in a queue of ambulances outside a hospital. As Lilly Baxandall arrived at Glan Clwyd Hospital, North Wales, 11 ambulances were waiting to hand over patients. And, by the time she was finally admitted to the Bodelwyddan hospital four hours later, her family said it was too late. The former British Airways catering supervisor, who lived in a bungalow in Abergele, North Wales, developed pneumonia and died the following day. Lilly Baxandall, 95, was taken to Glan Clwyd Hospital, north Wales (pictured) at around 5pm on September 1 last year after a fall. She was not admitted to A&E until 9.50pm, and died the next day . It is the latest shocking death threatening to undermine patient faith in the Welsh Ambulance Service, which has met its response targets just once in the past two-and-a-half years. Labour, which runs the health service in Wales under devolution, has cut health funding by more than 8 per cent since 2010. And the cuts have seen longer waits for ambulances, far more people waiting more than four hours in A&E than in England, and poor cancer care. At a pre-inquest hearing yesterday, Miss Baxandall's great-niece Kate Thomas, a locum doctor who helped care for her great-aunt in the ambulance, said: 'By the time she was admitted it was far too late.' The court, sitting in Ruthin, North Wales, was told Miss Baxandall’s cleaner dialled 999 on September 1 last year when she found her on the floor after a fall. She had a cut on her head but was still conscious. A paramedic arrived soon after but it was two more hours before an ambulance arrived, making it to the casualty department of Glan Clwyd Hospital by 5pm. Coroner John Gittins said Miss Baxandall's case is particularly concerning as it is the third such case he has had to deal with . At that time, Coroner John Gittins said, there was evidence to suggest 11 ambulances were queuing outside waiting to discharge patients. ‘Over the course of the next few hours she began to decline and paramedics were becoming concerned at the delay in admission,’ the coroner said. She was finally admitted at 9.50pm – almost seven hours after the paramedic first arrived. A post-mortem examination found she died of pneumonia due to bleeding on the brain, caused by the head injury. The coroner said he would call a neurosurgeon to give evidence on whether Miss Baxandall would have had a better chance of survival had she been admitted sooner. Betsi Cadwaladr Health Board, which runs Glan Clwyd Hospital, last week said it was struggling due to cuts to the Labour-run NHS – as it urged patients not to go to GPs for free prescriptions to treat minor ailments. The coroner said he was concerned as Miss Baxandall’s death was the third he had dealt with recently where ambulance delays were a factor. He ordered bosses of the ambulance service and health board to give evidence at a full hearing, saying the ‘buck’ stopped with them. ‘I am particularly concerned because the issue of ambulance delays is very much on the public agenda,’ Mr Gittins said. The coroner referred to Fred Pring, 74, and Clive Turner, 73, who both died in North Wales after ambulance delays. Fred Pring, 74 (left), died in March 2013 after waiting 42 minutes for an ambulance, during which time his wife called 999 four times. Clive Turner, 74 (right), died a year later after waiting five hours for an ambulance . An inquest into Miss Baxandall's death at Ruthin coroner's court (pictured) will try to establish why she was kept waiting for so long, and if she could have been saved if she was admitted sooner . Retired gardener Mr Pring died in March 2013 after paramedics took 42 minutes to respond. He suffered heart failure and died before an ambulance arrived. In March 2014, retired engineer Mr Turner died after waiting five hours for an ambulance while suffering internal bleeding. He was then misdiagnosed at hospital and died the following day. Mr Gittins had ordered the ambulance service to make urgent changes, but yesterday said he now wanted to see ‘whether things are changing’. A spokesman for the Welsh Ambulance Service and Betsi Cadwaladr Health Board said they were co-operating with the coroner and ‘liaising closely’ with Miss Baxandall’s family. In another case, a man waited almost an hour for an ambulance after severing a finger while mowing the lawn in Nefyn, North Wales. Owen Morgan, 70, lost his right index finger and severely damaged two others on Friday morning. Last night his family said the delay may have stopped medics from saving his finger.","Lilly Baxandall, 95, was found on floor of her home with cut to her head .

At Google's headquarters in Silicon Valley, the princess is the one defending the castle. Meet Parisa Tabriz, the 31-year-old with perhaps the most enchanted job title in engineering -- ""Google Security Princess."" Her job is to hack into the most popular web browser on the planet, trying to find flaws in the system before the ""black hats"" do. Indeed, much like the good and bad witches of the Wizard of Oz, hackers are described as having ""white"" or ""black"" hats. To defeat Google's attackers, Tabriz must firstly think like them. In this cyberspace battle, the data of around a billion Chrome users hangs in the balance -- and Tabriz wasn't going to settle for any old moniker. ""When I started, my official job title was 'Information Security Engineer,' which I thought was a bit boring and not really meaningful,"" said the Iranian-Polish-American, speaking a million miles an hour over the phone from Google HQ. ""So I changed it to 'Security Princess' as more of a tongue-in-cheek thing. I've never been exceptionally girly or fit the stereotype of a princess, so it was a bit ironic for me to go by that name -- and then it stuck!"" Tabriz's role has evolved dramatically in the eight years since she first started working at Google. Back then, the young graduate from Illinois University was one of 50 security engineers -- today there are over 500. ""Our users include presidents of foreign countries -- I hope Obama uses Chrome too. It includes really highly-targeted individuals, political dissidents, journalists, and people who just want to casually use the internet,"" she said. ""Google depends on those users trusting us with their data. So if we can't protect it, we have no business."" Cybercrime has come a long way in the past decade -- from the cliched Nigerian Prince Scam to credit card theft, and suspected government surveillance over emails. Tabriz's biggest concern now is the people who find bugs in Google's software, and sell the information to governments or criminals. To combat this, the company has set up a Vulnerability Rewards Program, paying anywhere from $100 to $20,000 for reported glitches. ""What we've seen in the last couple of years is what we suspect to be governments trying to intercept communications,"" said Tabriz. ""In one case, there were Iranian-region Gmail users whose connection was being intercepted."" ""These incidents are especially scary since they seem to be carried out by large, well-funded organizations or governments,"" she added. It's a world away from Tabriz's computer-free childhhod home in Chicago. The daughter of an Iranian-American doctor father, and Polish-American nurse mother, Tabriz had little contact with computers until she started studying engineering at college. Gaze across a line-up of Google security staff today and you'll find women like Tabriz are few and far between -- though in the last few years she has hired more female tech whizzes. She admits there's an obvious gender imbalance in Silicon Valley, but for once is stumped on the fault. ""Clearly the numbers make you think 'what is the problem that there aren't more women working in security, that there aren't more women working in technology?"" she said. ""And it does make me think what is the problem here? Is it the culture or the atmosphere?"" Funnily enough, during training sessions Tabriz first asks new recruits to hack not a computer, but a vending machine. ""There's this idea that you need to be a super genius computer geek to be a hacker. But in reality, I think anybody can be a hacker in the real world -- just think of all the non-software examples,"" said Tabriz. ""A lot of people ask me what's the best answer I've been given to the vending machine problem, and the real answer is there is none. Some people think about how they'd steal their favorite snack; some people figure out how to steal the entire machine of snacks; and some people figure out how they could add some sort of functionality to the machine that wasn't there before"" Tabriz's job is as much about technological know-how, as understanding the psychology of attackers. ""Anybody who's working in defense -- police officers, security, or law enforcement -- has to stop and think 'what is the enemy or the attacker going to do?'"" she said. ""Because you always want to stay one step ahead of them."" Read more from Make, Create, Innovate: . The world's largest machine gets ready to restart .

1ffd0ff75cb8f9cfee1e83f812c904079b53ce26,"(CNN)Fortunately, the intensive diplomatic efforts to prevent a nuclear-armed Iran and another war didn't stop after 47 Republican senators, led by freshman Sen. Tom Cotton, appeared to try to goad Iran's leaders into forgoing a diplomatic solution to the nuclear dispute. Neither have they stopped since Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu delivered what was effectively a reelection campaign speech on the House floor. Despite so many concerted efforts to sabotage our diplomats, our negotiators are still hard at work to secure an agreement with Tehran that, if successfully concluded, will go down in the annals of diplomatic history as marking a new era for U.S.-Iran relations. Indeed, progress toward a political framework would move us closer to attainable safeguards on Iran's nuclear program as well as jump-start a more productive relationship that could pay extra dividends for years to come. Before President Obama's phone call with Iranian President Hassan Rouhani last fall -- the first direct contact between U.S. and Iranian heads of state in more than 30 years -- such an agreement seemed unthinkable. Now, with clear-eyed diplomacy, negotiators from the U.S. and five other countries, plus Iran, are in reach of delivering a peaceful resolution to the decade-long impasse over Iran's nuclear program. Diplomats have tackled thorny, complex nonproliferation issues that have never been comprehensively addressed in a multilateral agreement before. They have labored to eliminate Iran's potential pathways to a nuclear weapon while allowing the country to maintain a limited nuclear energy program, but under what is arguably the world's most locked-down nuclear inspections regime. U.S., German, British, French, Chinese and Russian negotiators are continuing to build on the solid success of the preliminary nuclear accord negotiated last year, the so-called Joint Plan of Action. That plan continues to grant inspectors daily access to Iran's nuclear facilities in order to verify its adherence to the agreement.  As a result, Iran's nuclear program will be frozen for the first time since its inception, as diplomats craft a comprehensive resolution to this standoff. If and when a final agreement is reached, the President may temporarily waive some sanctions if Iran's compliance can be verified. Congress has, for its part, authorized the President to provide limited, temporary and reversible sanctions relief so long as doing so advances U.S. national security interests. As former National Security Adviser Brent Scowcroft and countless other national security experts have attested, such a diplomatic solution to this crisis is squarely in the national interests of the United States. In exchange for Iran following through on its promises to constrain its program in accordance with the agreement, the U.S. Congress will be asked to lift sanctions permanently. If Tehran demonstrates its long-term commitment to limit its nuclear program to exclusively peaceful purposes, then when the time comes, Congress should be ready to lift the sanctions. In the interim, it is crucial that all parties scrupulously adhere to the terms of this landmark agreement.  While Iran must not install unauthorized centrifuges, attempt a secret program or otherwise fail to adhere to the agreement, the U.S. Congress also has responsibilities under the agreement, including appropriations for its execution and refraining from imposing new sanctions in violation of either the letter or the spirit of the deal. All this suggests that to jeopardize such progress at this critical stage would be reckless, if not foolhardy. Of course, history suggests that we should be cautious. And the stakes are indeed extremely high. But the last thing the world needs is another major war in the Middle East. Members of Congress should therefore join the preeminent statesmen, military officers and the overwhelming majority of the American public in welcoming what is poised to be a diplomatic success -- one that could protect U.S. security and prevent further instability in the Middle East that would result from a nuclear Iran. We should ensure that our diplomats have the support they need to reach the finish line and that our President is able to cross it.","47 Republican senators last week sent an open letter to Iran's leadership .

Battling: This notice has been posted on the church's website, pleading for donations so that Dollar can 'continue reaching a lost and dying world for the Lord Jesus Christ' Goal: Dollar wants to spend the $65 million he hopes to make in donations on a Gulfstream G650 business jet, a plane favored by billionaires that bills itself as the fastest plane built in civil aviation . Televangelist: Creflo Dollar is the founder of World Changers Church International, which has about 30,000 members and an 8,500 seater amphitheater in Atlanta called the 'World Dome' Among the billionaires who own a Gulfstream G650 are Steve Jobs' wife Lauren Powell Jobs, Wynn Resorts CEO Steve Wynn add Nike co-founder Phil Knight. There is a long waiting list for the aircraft, with the next round of planes not due until 2017. According to the Creflo Dollar Ministry's website: 'The ministry's current airplane, was built in 1984, purchased by the ministry in 1999 and has since logged four million miles. 'Recently on an overseas trip to a global conference, one of the engines failed. Arrested: The Reverend was charged in 2012 for allegedly attacking his teenage daughter . 'By the grace of God, the expert pilot, who's flown with Creflo for almost 20 years, landed the plane safely without injury or harm to any passengers.' The Christian Post first reported that Dollar insisted that he needs the jet to continue sharing the word of Jesus. He preaches all over the world, but primarily works out of a 8,500-seat amphitheater in Atlanta called the 'World Dome', satelliting the sermons to churches all over the country. The website pledge continued: 'Believe it or not, there are still millions of people on this planet who have never heard of Jesus Christ and know nothing of His greatness.' 'Our hearts desire to see precious lives changed and snatched out of darkness and thrust into His marvelous light! 'We need your help to continue reaching a lost and dying world for the Lord Jesus Christ,"" the appeal continued before asking supporters of the ministry to sow a $300 seed into the airplane fund, billed Project G650.' However, according to Financial Juneteenth, a Report of the Senate Finance Committee, Minority Staff Review of WCCI, found that Dollar's current jet had also been used for a variety of vacation flights, including stops in Las Vegas, Nevada, Miami, Florida and Hawaii, citing Federal Aviation Administration figures. Dollar has refused over the years to disclose his salary, but has an estimated net worth of $27 million. He has five children to his wife, Taffi, who he married in 1985. Couple: Dollar and his wife, Taffi (pictured together) were married in 1985 and have five children . Home: Dollar and his family primarily live in this multi-million dollar in Fayettville, Georgia, south of Atlanta . In June 2012, his 15-year-old daughter called 911, saying her father repeatedly punched and choked her at their Atlanta home. The teenager also said it wasn't the first time something like that had happened and that she felt threatened living in the house. Dollar was arrested and charged with family brutality and juvenile cruelty. The charges were later dropped, but he was required to complete a three-month anger management program. At his next sermon, two days following the arrest, Dollar spent several minutes addressing the incident, starting with: 'I will say this emphatically: I should have never been arrested.' Dollar has strenuously denied the accusations, saying it was a family argument with 'heightened emotions'. Damaged: Dollar says the church's current plane, bought in 1999, is broken and needs to be replaced, or he will be unable to continue working around the world . Dollar's wife Taffi has been known to introduce her husband at his sermons. During her address, she claims Dollar comes 'face to face with God, like Moses'. She also includes an admonition saying that 'every tongue that rises up against' (Dollar) 'will be struck down', Financial Juneteenth reported. The World Changers Church International (WCCI) has about 30,000 constituents. Controversial theology: Reverend Dollar's ministries are based on the prosperity gospel, which teaches that God wants to bless the faithful with earthly riches .","Reverend Creflo Dollar is the head of World Changers Church International .

e5d94716c1baba098f200b97a675a1e2c006007b,"Suzette Davenport said tougher sanctions are needed for those caught making calls, sending texts and checking emails while driving . DRIVERS who use mobile phones at the wheel should be banned from the roads, Britain’s top traffic officer said yesterday. Suzette Davenport insisted that a rise in offending showed much tougher punishments were needed to deter the worst culprits. But she claimed ministers were too scared of losing votes in May’s election to act against the estimated 500,000 motorists who break the law every day. The Gloucestershire chief constable said the absence of proper penalties risked making it socially acceptable to text or surf the internet while driving. The offence of using a hand-held mobile at the wheel currently attracts only a £100 fine with three penalty points. Miss Davenport said: ‘If someone is caught twice using a mobile phone within a period of time we should be considering things like disqualifications. ‘If we don’t do something fundamentally different we are going to have lost this. 'I have had those conversations with ministers. I would take a much harder line in terms of outcomes from enforcement. The minister doesn’t like my proposal.’ Asked why ministers had rejected her call, she told the BBC: ‘Probably timing’s not great. I don’t think it would be popular with lots of people. 'An election is not too far away so I’m sure they’re not likely to pick up and run with anything that they feel is not likely to be helpful to them in the next election.’ Miss Davenport, who speaks on road issues for the Association of Chief Police Officers, said drivers repeatedly glancing at their smartphones were effectively using a computer. Her intervention follows the release of figures last week showing that mobile offending has risen despite numerous crackdowns. Robert Goodwill, Tory transport minister, rejected the claim that he was blocking road safety reform for electoral reasons. Some 1.6 per cent of Britain's estimated 36million drivers were spotted using a handheld phone while at the wheel last year – up on 1.4 per cent for a similar exercise carried out five years earlier in 2009 . He insisted the Government was reviewing the introduction of a six-point penalty, two instances of which would trigger a ban. And he turned his fire on the police, saying chief constables were too quick to take the easy option of using speed cameras instead of deploying more traffic officers. ‘One of the reasons people do these things is because they think they can get away with it,’ he said. ‘It is important that police and crime commissioners and chief constables look at the resources they put into this as opposed to other more easy offences to detect like speeding where cameras can catch people on an industrial scale. ‘There is no point increasing the penalties if we are not actually catching people.’ Research shows that the distraction effect of using a mobile phone is worse than being over the limit on drink or drugs. But the penalties are far lower – unless motorists are convicted of careless or dangerous driving. And official figures show that the number of fixed penalty notices has fallen 26 per cent while offending – as observed in spot checks by transport officials – has risen 14 per cent since 2009. Edmund King of the AA said: ‘Basically we need more cops in cars to target the mobile phone abusers that we observe behind the wheel on most journeys. ‘Most drivers would welcome harsher penalties but we still need the perceived risk of being caught to increase before more drivers hang up behind the wheel.’ The row threatens to overshadow the introduction today of ‘drug driving’ laws. Drivers face prosecution if they are caught exceeding new limits which have, for the first time, been laid down for eight illegal drugs and eight prescription drugs. The levels for the illegal drugs, which include heroin, cocaine and cannabis, virtually mean there will be zero tolerance for drivers caught with these substances in their system. Police will be able to use ‘drugalysers’ to screen for cannabis and cocaine at the roadside. Officers will also be able to test for these and other drugs including ecstasy, LSD, ketamine and heroin at a police station, even if a driver passes the roadside check. Under the existing law it is illegal to use a phone while driving, even when stopped at traffic lights or queuing in traffic. If caught, a driver faces an automatic fixed penalty notice worth £100 and 3 penalty points on their licence. Only if it goes to court do they risk being disqualified, but the maximum fine is only £1,000. By comparison, drink-drivers face 6 months in jail, a fine of up to £5,000 fine and a driving ban for at least a year, rising to three years if convicted twice in a decade. The research revealed that using a handheld device is more distracting than alcohol or drugs, with drivers twice as likely to have their head down and eyes off the road while texting or using the internet. Some 1.6 per cent of Britain's estimated 36million drivers were spotted using a handheld phone while at the wheel last year – up on 1.4 per cent for a similar exercise carried out five years earlier in 2009. Two thirds of those observed breaking the law (1.1 per cent) last year had the phone in their hand rather than held to their ear – suggesting that they were using it to text or check the internet. The figures prompted Mr Clegg to call for tougher penalties. Speaking on his LBC radio phone-in, he said: 'I just don’t think we should beat about the bush here. It might seem like someone, “Oh I’m going to make a quick call home saying I’m doing to be late because I’m stuck in traffic"". 'it is really dangerous. The evidence is overwhelming. You cannot call and devote the same attention as you should to keep yourself safe and others whilst driving a vehicle. 'That’s why in this government we’ve actually increased the penalty, we’ve dramatically increased the penalties, just I think a couple of years ago. 'I personally would be prepared to go further until we send out a clear and unambiguous message that this is dangerous and it should not be done.'","Suzette Davenport calls for prison terms for using a phone while driving .

fc1149751162f420a03b4ad8e650ecba14e3d114,"Things got very steamy this morning at the Today show studios when host Hoda Kotb and TV personality Regis Philbin took part in new charity dare The Twizzler Challenge live on air, and shared a passionate - if very one-sided - kiss. Hoda, 50, looked as though she got rather more than she bargained for when Regis, 83, energetically took the lead on the act; requiring them to each take opposite ends of one Twizzler, place them in their mouths and nibble the licorice until their lips met in the middle. When Hoda's quick peck on Regis' lips at the end of the challenge did not seem to satisfy her former NBC co-host, he grabbed her head with both hands and delivered her a passionate smooch, as Hoda froze up in surprise. Scroll down for video . Good cause: Much like the now-infamous ALS Ice Bucket Challenge, the Twizzler test has taken off, and benefits Manhattan-based charity New York Collaborates for Autism . Magic moment: The stunt required Hoda and Regis to each take opposite ends of one Twizzler, place them in their mouths and nibble the licorice until their lips met in the middle . Hoda and Regis were officially dared to take on the Twizzler Challenge last week by Today hosts Matt Lauer and Kathie Lee, who themselves shared a series of rather awkward, perfunctory kisses during their on-screen moment. Once the concept, which aims to raise awareness for autism, was explained to Regis during his guest segment on the show this morning, he enthusiastically asked: 'Are we going to kiss?' 'I'm not sure,' responded Hoda, before timidly spritzing his open mouth with breath spray. 'Let me look at your lips,' Regis exclaimed, leaning in. 'She could swallow me! I've never seen lips like that. Honest to God, something's going to happen.' And indeed it did. Hoda nibbled at the licorice straw until she reached Regis' lips, before issuing him a conservative peck. Too much? Today host Hoda Kotb, 50, (right) got more than she bargained for as part of this morning's Twizzler Challenge, when former co-host Regis Philbin, 83, (left) smothered her with an enthusiastic smacker . Not finished: Hoda gave Regis a quick peck, before jerking her head away from him . Regis then launched in for a full-on smooch, as Hoda darted her head away, only for Regis to grab her back and give her a lingering mouth-to-mouth smacker. 'Boy you look like you went in there!' squealed Kathie Lee, as Hoda recovered in stunned silence. 'It was pretty good,' attested Regis, lipstick smeared over his face. 'You got a boyfriend?' Much like the now-infamous ALS Ice Bucket Challenge, those who fail to complete the Twizzler test after being nominated have to donate to Manhattan-based charity New York Collaborates for Autism. Last week at the NBC studios,  Matt Lauer and Kathie Lee were nominated by fellow Today correspondent Meredith Vieira. Meredith explained that she first took the challenge with Today co-anchor Willie Geist the previous week on her talk show and later donated $5,000 to support autism programs nationwide. Get away! Hoda tried to push Regis away as he lunged in to take the kiss even further . Recovery: Hoda was visibly shaken after the amorous display, which took place live on air . 'This is clearly a transparent attempt by Meredith once gain to make out with her colleague,' Willie joked on the morning show. Meredith immediately made it clear that she intended to challenge Matt, but remained coy about who his partner would be. 'Is there anybody around that we can ask?' Willie said. Savannah Guthrie, who was sitting next to Matt, quickly left her chair. 'I am willing to get up out of this seat,' she said as she made room for Matt's partner. When Kathie Lee walked on stage, Matt enthusiastically told her: 'Get over here.' Panic: Ironically, it was Regis who was most concerned about the challenge before it began, telling Hoda that he was worried she would 'swallow him' because of the size of her lips . Kathie Lee joked to Matt: 'Your world is going to be on fire.' 'This is nothing compared to what goes on in the make-up room,' she added. As Kathie Lee and Matt sat face to face, they both noted that their awkward encounter was all in aid of a good cause. 'And then we get to challenge somebody,' Matt explained. Kathie Lee stared at Matt with her eyes wide open before she started to furiously eat the Twizzler that was in her mouth, quickly moving towards her partner. 'Really aggressive,' Willie commented from the sidelines. Follow the leader: Hoda and Regis were officially challenged to take on The Twizzler Challenge by Today hosts Matt Lauer and Kathie Lee, who themselves took part last week (pictured) Matt pulled away as Kathie Lee's lips brushed his, only to move back into to give her another kiss. 'I love you anyway,' he said. 'I would have done that for nothing.' Someone else joked: 'Who the Lady and whose the Tramp?' After their epic kiss, Kathie Lee nominated her former co-host Regis Philbin and her current co-star Hoda Kotb for the Twizzler Challenge. After their epic kiss, Kathie nominated Regis and Hoda for the Twizzler Challenge. But Matt had a different pairing in mind, noting that the cast of Mad Men would be on the show on Monday. Fun moment: Hoda's fellow Today show hosts Willie Geist and Meredith Vieira took the Twizzler Challenge on her talk show . New nominees: Daily Mail Online Editor-at-Large Piers Morgan and Nina Parker also took the challenge on Access Hollywood Live . 'I'm available,' Savannah said as soon as the good looking cast was mentioned. Matt ultimately chose actors Jon Hamm and John Slattery to take on the challenge. 'If John Slattery needs an understudy for that Twizzler Challenge with Jon Hamm, I am available,' Savannah reminded Matt again. The Twizzler Challenge started earlier this month at Comedy Central's Night of Too Many Stars benefit for autism, which was hosted by Jon Stewart. When someone on Twitter dared Willie and Orange is the New Black star Uzo Aduba to have a Lady and the Tramp moment with licorice in exchange for a donation, the Twizzler Challenge was born. Access Hollywood co-hosts Billy Bush and Kit Hoover also took up the same candy-based encounter on their show last Friday before nominating Daily Mail Online Editor-at-Large Piers Morgan and his fellow guest Nina Parker to do the same. 'I got to say that was really enjoyable,' Piers said after they completed the challenge.","The Twizzler Challenge is a new charitable dare aimed at raising awareness about autism .

15682f164646090d8c669ffbbe625280b56558d6,"A star that is travelling fast enough to escape the gravitational clutches of our galaxy has been discovered by a team of astronomers. The amazing stellar object attained its rapid speed when a nearby star exploded as a supernova, sending it out of the Milky Way. At its current speed it would make the journey from Earth to the moon in just five minutes - a trip which took the Apollo spacecraft three days. Scroll down for a video showing an artist's impression of the event . Astronomers in Hawaii have found the fastest 'unbound' star in the galaxy. Called US 708 it is moving at 745 miles (1,200km) per second. It will leave the galaxy in about 25 million years. This artist's concept shows a star (left) being ejected from the galaxy, although in reality the supernova would have been faded long ago . The star, known as US 708, was first discovered in 1982 by Dr Peter Usher of Pennsylvania State University but had since then remained ignored. However, a team of astronomers led by the University of Hawaii at Manoa has now re-examined the star, and found that it breaks the galactic speed record for an 'unbound' star. US 708 is almost 62,000 light-years from Earth, and is on a path that will take it out of the Milky Way in about 25 million years. Type 1a: A white dwarf accumulates material from a stellar companion until it undergoes runaway nuclear fusion and explodes. Non-standard type 1a: Two white dwarfs merge until their combined mass causes an explosion. Type II: A star at least nine times the mass of the sun eventually experiences a core collapse as its fuel runs out, causing it to explode. Type 1b and 1c: A star undergoes core collapse but most of its outer hydrogen has already been lost to stellar winds. Hypernova: Extreme type of supernova, 50 times as energetic as other supernovas, resulting in a black hole. The exact cause of them is unknown. Using the 10-metre Keck II and Pan-Starrs1 telescopes in Hawaii, the astronomers calculated that the star is moving at about 745 miles (1,200km) per second. This makes it the fastest ‘rogue’ star in the galaxy - one that is no longer orbiting the centre. ‘At that speed, you could travel from Earth to the moon in five minutes,’ said Dr Eugene Magnier of the University of Hawaii at Manoa. ‘By observing the sky repeatedly over several years, the Pan-Starrs1 survey, let us make a movie of the motions of the stars in the sky. ‘That enables us to study the behavioirs of extremely rare and weird stars like US 708.’ While a handful of other stars escaping the galaxy are known, this is the first to have been found that was ejected by a thermonuclear supernova explosion. US 708, which is a helium-rich white dwarf, was propelled at high speeds when a more massive white dwarf star nearby in a tight binary blew up. At the speed US 708 is travelling it would make the journey from Earth to the moon in just five minutes - a trip which took the Apollo astronauts three days. Pictured is the view of Earth seen by the Apollo 8 crew as they circled the moon in December 1968 . This particular class of supernova is known as type 1a, where material is transferred between one star and another until one reaches a critical mass, and explodes. Often, the secondary star is obliterated in the resulting explosion, or pushed away at a more sedate speed. It is 'pushed' away because the loss of its companion means it no longer has a star to orbit, but retains its forwards momentum, so it is flung into space. The specific characteristics of this binary system, its distance and the mass of its companion, allowed US 708 to remain intact while still achieving record speeds for an unbound star. Stars like the sun are bound to our galaxy by its gravity, and orbit its centre at relatively moderate velocities, typically tens to a few hundreds of kilometres per second. Only so-called hyperveolocity stars are known to travel so fast that they are unbound to the galaxy. US 708, which is a helium-rich white dwarf, was propelled at high speeds when a more massive white dwarf star nearby in a tight binary blew up (illustration shown). It is the first star found to be leaving the galaxy caused by such an event, and could provide an insight into these types of supernova . In addition, to escape from the Milky Way an object needs to exceed the ‘escape velocity’ - the strength of its gravitational pull. The escape velocity of our galaxy is about 375 miles (600km) per second, which US 708 easily exceeds. Astronomers hope that studying the star could help reveal how such helium-rich stars and thermonuclear supernovae are linked.","Astronomers in Hawaii have found the fastest 'unbound' star in the galaxy .

Victorian Liberal MP Inga Peulich claims she was bullied by members of her own party . Upper House Mary Wooldridge admits that the the party has lost female voters which is perhaps due to the inappropriate treatment of women during the preselection process and also workplace bullying . The internal Liberal Party report apparently found that, during preselection, only female candidates were asked questions about their family and personal life. The report outlines the Liberal Party's unprofessional questions toward women about their personal lives during the preselection process . 'How were they going to balance family and political life?' and 'Who would cook the meals?' were some of the questions asked according to the report. It also mentioned a number of occasions that 'involved party members in limited areas engaging in intimidation, threatening and bullying behaviours towards female party members and members of Parliament,' The Age reported. The report made 14 recommendations, including stepping up general participation of women and increasing the number of females in the party. Upper house Mary Wooldridge reportedly noted that the Liberal party has lost female voters. 'We've gone from a party where women clearly vote for us, to one where they clearly do not,' she said. The internal report also suggested that a women's network be created to boost morale and allow Liberal women to connect to each other and questioned the need for spouses to be included in the preselection process.

1cea82478dab92d4a830be833f6460589e6dfd02,"Grandmother Anna Maria Thomas, 61, from Putney, London, was strangled to death by her lodger, six months after she met him at church . A lodger strangled a Mormon grandmother to death after she invited him to stay at her flat to avoid paying the so-called bedroom tax. Anna Maria Thomas, 61, asked Felix Gutierrez-Cortez to live at her two-bedroom home in Putney, south west London, after they met in June 2013 through the Church of Jesus Christ of Latter Day Saints. The 34-year-old, who previously slept rough at Clapham Junction station, moved in to act as Ms Thomas's carer but also to fill her second befroom, which would have otherwise been subject to the Government's controversial under-occupancy charge. The charge, which came into force in April 2013, limits a tenant's housing benefit  if they have an unused bedroom in their property. But the Old Bailey heard how Ms Thomas was killed by her lodger, just six months after the arrangement was made. The court heard how Ms Thomas was found strangled to death in her flat on December 10, her face swollen and her eyes bulging out of her head. She was covered with a pink duvet and propped up by a blood-soaked floral pillow, the court heard. Paramedics had gone to her flat after Gutierrez-Cortez phoned 999, saying he had found her lifeless body on the living room floor. But it later emerged that Ms Thomas had been lying dead in her flat for up to two days. The Old Bailey was told that the postmortem gave the cause of death as compression of the neck, which was most likely caused by strangulation. The Spanish-born Belgian national was today cleared by a jury of murdering his landlady, but convicted of manslaughter on the grounds of diminished responsibility. He has been remanded in custody to be sentenced on 24 April. Judge John Bevan QC told him: 'You have been convicted of causing Anna Thomas' death, but it is clear that you are ill and therfore you have been convicted of manslaughter and not murder.' The court heard how the pair would attend church together at St Marks in Battersea, although Gutierrez-Cortez was not with her when she was last seen alive on Sunday 8 December. The pensioner had invited Felix Gutierrez-Cortez, 34, to live with her at her two-bedroom flat in Southfields (pictured) so that she could stop her housing benefit being reduced due to the so-called bedroom tax . Prosecutor David Howker QC told the court: 'Before he lived there he had been a rough sleeper in and around Clapham Junction. 'Their cohabitation was no doubt a convenient arrangement providing him with a rent free roof over his head and it meant she would avoid the spare bedroom tax and have someone around the house.' The pensioner's last movements included a visit to church, followed by a trip to the library and Sainsbury's in the Clapham Junction area. The last sighting of her alive was when she was seen getting off the bus near her flat, two days before she was reported dead. 'The prosecution say she met her death at the hands of the defendant. Most likely on the evening of 8 December,' said Mr Howker. The court heard how Gutierrez-Cortez said he had been away since Sunday and had only returned on Tuesday to find his landlady on the floor. He later told police he had slept on the sofa from Sunday until Tuesday when he had found the body. He said she had gone into the spare room to meditate, and he had stayed in the living room for two days. Officers became concerned about his mental state when he claimed to have been a Vatican researcher. He was taken back to the police station where he was later arrested for murder. Doctors concluded he was 'extremely psychotic' and he was sectioned under the Mental Health Act. Gutierrez-Cortez, of no fixed address, denied murder and manslaughter, but was convicted of the lesser charge because of his mental illness. Investigating officer Detective Inspector Andy Rees had previously asked people who knew the victim to come forward. He said: 'Our investigations demonstrated that she was a caring mother and grandmother and a deeply religious woman with a wide circle of friends who will miss her deeply - I hope the conviction today provides them with a measure of comfort.' The bedroom tax restricts the amount of housing benefit that council and housing association tenants can claim. The amount of rent you can claim housing benefit for is reduced by 14 per cent if you have one 'spare' bedroom. A spokesperson for the Department for Work and Pensions said: 'Many people live with lodgers in or out of social housing and this tragic and isolated incident should not be seen as an indictment of this practice, nor of the broader policy.'","Anna Maria Thomas, 61, met Felix Gutierrez-Cortez at church in June 2013 .

10674f2fe4197659b8a12f2a9c291ff47dce3eb9,"A Fort Worth, Texas elementary school has come under fire from parents who claim certain teachers and administrators have cultivated a 'toxic' environment for their children. At a Monday board meeting, parents turned out to support Kourtney Glaser, the former vice principal at Comanche Springs Elementary School in the Eagle Mountain-Saginaw Independent School District, who was placed on administrative leave after she experienced heavy vaginal bleeding that the school claims was caused by 'severe anxiety.' Glaser, 31, and her doctors, have firmly stated the bleeding, which occurred during a district training session and required Glaser to seek immediate medical attention, was the result of an intrauterine device being lodged in her uterine wall. This was just the beginning of the parents complaints as well, as they also voiced their concern over 'staff drinking,' the 'use of disparaging nicknames for teachers, parents and even children,' and a principal who has been reassigned after her 'bullying tactics.' Scroll down for video . Kourtney Glaser (above), the vice principal at Comanche Springs Elementary School in Fort Worth, Texas was placed on leave because she had vaginal bleeding . Once parents got wind of this news, many rallied behind Glasser, and seemed to place most of the blame on the principal, Katy Maurer (above in leopard print top) According to the Fort Worth Star-Telegram, Glaser was forced to go to the emergency room on January 28 when she began suddenly bleeding, and two days later had her device removed to stop the trauma. She was not allowed to return to work however, and instead placed on leave after receiving a letter shortly after that said her bleeding had occurred on multiple occasions and was the result of 'severe anxiety.' On top of this, she was told she would need to see two doctors and sign a waiver releasing her medical records before she would be allowed to return to work. The letter also claimed she had trouble speaking in front of large groups, something Glasser denied in an interview with ABC 8. At this point, some parents at the school became aware of the situation, and seemed to place the blame on Katy Maurer, the principal of the school. The situation then became even further complicated when just last week Maurer filed a police report claiming she was being harassed by an employee at the school and her husband. The name of the employee was not released, but it was revealed to be someone who was on leave. In her report, Maurer claimed this employee had posted 'very hateful things' about her on social media, and that these posts had led to national attention. The employee also reportedly referred to Maurer as an 'idiot,' while the employee's husband is accused in the report of stalking Maurer, coming to the school unannounced, following her to restaurants, and showing up at her home. Maurer, 34,said this has been going on for close to five weeks. The district said it is examining the claims, while a lawyer for Glaser, Brittany Lannen, all but admitted she was the woman named in the report, saying; '“Once the aggressor is caught, they attempt to play the victim. Thankfully with today’s technology and social media, Ms. Maurer’s false accusations can easily be dismissed with a quick view of Mrs. Glaser’s social media.' She also added that Glaser's husband was not ever told he could not be on school grounds. Maurer, meanwhile, has been reassigned to another school in the district.

Archaeologists have discovered the long lost remains of Miguel de Cervantes - the author of  Don Quixote- in a Madrid chapel. Forensic scientists said they  found the bones of the famous Spanish writer and his family in Madrid's Convent of the Barefoot Trinitarians. The author of The Ingenious Gentleman Don Quixote of La Mancha,' considered the most influential work of Spanish literature, was buried in 1616 and the church was later rebuilt. But his remains were moved into the new building in the late 17th Century, and disappeared. His bones were lost for centuries until earlier this year when archaeologists used 3D scanners, infrared cameras and ground-penetrating radar to discover  a forgotten crypt under the building. Inside the niche, they found the lid of a coffin with the initials MC - for Miguel de Cervantes - and bones of at least ten people were also found inside the niche. Researchers said separating and identifying his badly damaged remains will be difficult but work is underway to recover his bones. Although there is no genetic proof at this stage, the team of anthropologists and archaeologists said they were confident of the claim on the basis of the documentary research they carried out. 'The remains are in a bad state of conservation and do not allow us to do an individual identification of Miguel de Cervantes,' forensic scientist Almudena Garcia Rubio told the BBC. Scroll down for video . 'But we are sure what the historical sources say is the burial of Miguel de Cervantes and the other people buried with him is what we have found.' Discovery: Experts analyse bones to find the remains of the 17th Century author Miguel de Cervantes at the Convent of the Barefoot Trinitarians in Madrid . On one of the wooden fragments the initials 'MC' can be clearly seen; investigators also discovered bones which they have determined belong to the late author Miguel de Cervantes . Cervantes was 69 when he died in 1616 and in accordance with his wishes, he was buried in the Convent of the Barefoot Trinitarians in Madrid's historic Barrio de las Letras, or Literary Quarter. 1547: Born near Madrid . 1571: Shot and wounded at Battle of Lepanto . 1575: Captured and enslaved for five years in Algiers . 1605: Publishes first part of The Ingenious Gentleman Don Quixote of La Mancha. 1615: Cervantes published the second part of his celebrated work . 1616: Cervantes dies aged 68, from suspected diabetes and with just six teeth remaining. He is buried at Convent of Barefoot Trinitarians . 1673: His remains are lost went when the convent is rebuilt . 2015: His tomb is rediscovered . His remains were then lost for centuries after his bones mysteriously went missing in 1673 when building works was done at the convent. Investigators were able to use clues from the author's own stories to help them identify the remains. Shortly before his death Cervantes wrote that he only has six teeth, but the most obvious marks were his battle wounds. In 1571, the writer was injured in the Battle of Lepanto, which pitted Ottoman Turkish forces against the Holy League, led by Spain. Aboard the ship La Marquesa, Cervantes was hit with three musket shots, two in the chest and one in his hand. Investigator Luis Avial told a news conference on Tuesday that Cervantes would be reburied 'with full honours' in the same convent after a new tomb had been built, according to his wishes. 'Cervantes asked to be buried there and there he should stay,' said Luis Avial, georadar expert on the search team. Excavation: A team of archaeologists and anthropologists take notes after starting the excavation work after identifying three unrecorded and unidentified graves in the chapel's crypt last January . Experts searching for the lost remains of the author of Don Quixote found wooden fragments of a casket bearing his initials with bones in and around them in a crypt in Madrid . The convent's religious order helped pay for his ransom after he was captured by pirates and held prisoner for five years in Algiers. He spent several months in a hospital in Sicily, but managed to recover. Cervantes is a towering figure in Spanish culture. His novel 'The Adventures of the Ingenious Nobleman Don Quixote of La Mancha' changed Spanish literature. The crypt will be opened to the public next year for the first time in centuries to coincide with the 400th anniversary of Cervantes' death. Experts pick through the broken coffins and dirt looking for bone fragments and other evidence . A plaque commemorating Cervantes on the Convent of Trinitarians in Madrid where he was buried . Don Quixote was the magnum opus of Miguel de Cervantes and was published in two volumes, in 1605 and 1615. It is considered the most influential work of Spanish literature and one of the greatest works of fiction ever published. The book is also believed be one of the most widely read and translated books in the world. Cervantes influence on the Spanish language has been so great that the language is often referred to as 'the language of Cervantes'. The author died in 1616 at the age of 69. In accordance with his wishes, Cervantes was buried in in the Convent of the Barefoot Trinitarians in Madrid's historic Barrio de las Letras, or Literary Quarter. His bones went missing in 1673 when work was undertaken at the convent. They were thought to have initially been taken to another convent before being returned.","Miguel de Cervantes was buried in 1616 in the Literary Quarter in Madrid .

Photographer Mr Joo, from Cleveland, Ohio, said: 'My journeys have taken me to some strange places but nothing quite like the abandoned home of a former professional boxer. 'It felt cold, rather empty and eerie - not so much a creepy eerie but a more interesting one. 'I knew Mike Tyson had once just hung out here and now I stood staring down everything that had been left behind. 'I loved the bathroom simply because of the view and the mirrored ceiling above the Jacuzzi tub. 'But the pool was probably my favourite just because of how incredibly large it was and thinking how vibrant it was at one point in time. 'The room was bigger than three of my houses, it was pretty incredible to look at while standing at one end. Everything was so full of life and now simply collects dust.

a06fbf021e761053db529adfb22cd24896d3dea1,"(CNN)If ignorance is bliss, then America must be a pleasure junkie, because we sure are chasing that dragon. The most recent example:  A school in New York sought to celebrate ""National Foreign Language Week"" by having the pledge of allegiance read in a different language every day.  You get one guess as to what happened when it was Arabic day. Complaints came in from both Jewish parents and people who had lost family in Afghanistan, according to the school superintendent. What language do they speak in Afghanistan?   Not Arabic.  The main languages are Dari and Pashto.  Perhaps this complaint illustrates why we need more education, not less. Unfortunately, this wasn't an isolated incident.    Earlier this year in Florida, parents were up in arms because a school taught about Islam in a history class.  And, there are perennial stories about ""Americans"" offended by a Spanish recitation of the pledge. Because of the outcry, Pine Bush students will now not hear the pledge in Italian, Spanish, Japanese, or French, as planned. That they were deprived of such a pedagogical exercise is bad enough.  What is worse is that the school district felt that it had to apologize.  The district's statement was a surrender to ignorance. ""The intention was to promote the fact that those who speak a language other than English still pledge to salute this great country. We sincerely apologize to any students, staff or community members who found this activity disrespectful."" Instead of the Pine Bush students learning about other languages and cultures, they learned that the ""heckler's veto"" and phony tales of ""offense"" trump open mindedness and the quest for knowledge.  At least they do in modern-day American education.  Perhaps this is a lesson best learned now, because once they get to college, it will be even worse. Our universities were once places where ideas were safe to flourish, and we went to question what we knew.  Today, they are places where disfavored ideas are all but banned.  According to students, Dixie State (Utah) bans posters that ""mock"" anyone, including former president Bush. Last year, Smith College's president apologized and there was a student outcry because students had ""hurt feelings"" when alumna Wendy Kaminer argued at a panel discussion moderated by the college president against using the euphemism ""the n-word"" in historical discussions. She believed that using the actual word, in context, was proper (and it is). Yes, censorship of ideas and speech is no longer a top-down or parent-driven phenomenon.  Now students themselves insist on being insulated from anything that might make them question their beliefs.  Instead of debating an anti-abortion protester, Oregon University students preferred to call the campus police -- who briefly took their side. George Will was slated to speak at Scripps College in a program specifically designed to challenge students' prevailing views.  But, since he challenged the feminist view of sexual assault on campus, Scripps pulled his invitation. When I went to college, I enjoyed challenging my beliefs.  I still do.  I hope that my children constantly do the same.  That is how we grow.  If we cannot tolerate foreign languages, or distasteful ideas, even in an educational setting, what hope do we have? When we have orthodoxy of thought, the very notion of liberty begins to shrivel up and die.  When the cry of ""I'm offended"" can shut down debate over philosophies, or learning about other cultures, or learning other languages, then what have our educational institutions become?  How much further will this enforced ignorance and orthodoxy need to go before education is just another word that comes untethered from its meaning? And the very inspiration for this column, a debate over the pledge of allegiance, makes the problem even more glaring.  A rote and thought-free-chant of mindless allegiance can't even be expressed in a different language?  Is America really so fragile that if a citizen proclaims ""fidelità agli Stati Uniti"" that it means anything less because it is in Italian? Perhaps this highlights more than the fact that we should step away from the brink of ignorance while we can.  Perhaps a good place to start is by doing away with enforced orthodoxy of thought and speech in the first place.  Perhaps a good place to do that would be by doing away with the pledge of allegiance itself. Perhaps if we pledged to uphold the Constitution, instead of a piece of cloth, we would be reminded of what really built this nation -- the Spirit of the Enlightenment. No views are so sacred that they need not be challenged.  Whether we are talking about learning to say the Pledge in Japanese, or hearing a speaker who challenges our beliefs, that is what education is about, not enforced ignorance.","NY school district canceled its experiment with the Pledge for ""National Foreign Language Week""
Marc Randazza says the outcry over an Arabic version was a triumph of ignorance over education ."
13db145a3e522043765f8d8b5f744b44c24c15e9,"A former professional boxer was part of a gang jailed for 77 years today for smuggling £11million of cocaine into the UK with the help of corrupt British Airways workers. Stephen O’Meara, 31, formerly of Datchet, Buckinghamshire was today locked up for 13 years for conspiracy to supply cocaine in February and August 2013. The drugs were transported in two loads and flown on British Airways flights to Heathrow Airport, Southwark Crown Court heard. Jailed: Stephen O’Meara, 31, was today locked up for 13 years for conspiracy to supply cocaine. He was was part of a gang jailed for 77 years in total . Drugs and ammunition: Police intercepted 40 kilos of cocaine (left) together with 100 rounds of 9mm ammunition . In total, police intercepted 40 kilos of cocaine with purity levels of more than 90% and a street level value of £11 million, together with 100 rounds of 9mm ammunition. Gang leader Harvinder Sanghera, 33, of Heston, Hounslow, London was caged for 30 years for importing cocaine and ammunition, while his ‘right hand man’ Savdeep Atkar, 33, of Grays, Essex was sentenced to 21 years for importing cocaine. Former boxer and personal trainer O’Meara was handed a 13-year sentence, as was David Brown, 51, of Biggleswade, Bedfordshire for supplying cocaine. Mark Graffius, defending O’Meara, said the former professional boxer met Sanghera while acting as his personal trainer. Sanghera and Aktar would watch O’Meara as he took part in sparring sessions, the court was told. Father-of-two O’Meara was a ‘gifted and dedicated’ boxer boxer who was ‘literally on the very cusp of becoming a top level international,’ according to Mr Graffius. He was managed by leading boxing promoter Frank Warren and had planned to move abroad to Spain where he was on the threshold of a ‘major, life-changing event.’ Sanghera was described as a ‘family man’ with two small children, who accrued a number of large debts through gambling. Jailed: Savdeep Atkar (left), David Brown (centre) and Harvinder Sanghera (right) were sentenced with Stephen O’Meara today . It was said Sanghera, who previously worked on a perfume production line in Acton, joined the drug conspiracy because he ‘owed debts to people you shouldn’t owe debts'. Aktar was described as a man brought up by a ‘hard-working’ and ‘god-fearing’ family. Brown was said to be a person who ‘tends to say yes to people.’ Sentencing the men, Judge Robbins said: ‘You four in your own different ways played your parts in ensuring that some very large quantities of cocaine were imported into this country. ‘You know very well the devastating effects these drugs may have on poor individuals. ‘The wholesale value of 40 kilogrammes of cocaine would have been more than £2m, but the street value much higher. ‘This was a sophisticated, well organised, and determined criminal network. ‘Those towards the top end of the organisation, Atkar and Sanghera, were capable of masterminding and resourcing such an operation.’ Police intercepted the drugs and ammunition. This picture shows the officers' search of a Surrey address . A total of 40 kilos of cocaine (left) together with 100 rounds of 9mm ammunition (right) were smuggled into the UK . Judge Robbins said he agreed that the two disrupted importations were indicative of a much larger operation. He added that Sanghera was ‘closely associated’ with the producers of the drug in Mexico, and had made numerous trips to North America to meet them. Judge Robbins described Atkar as Sanghera’s ‘right-hand man’ and ‘lieutenant,’ who had encouraged British Airways employees to abuse their positions of trust. ‘The smuggling of firearms is every bit as significant and dangerous as smuggling drugs,’ said Judge Robbins of Sanghera’s firearms offence. There was sobbing in a packed public gallery as sentence was passed.","Stephen O’Meara, 31, was locked up for 13 years for supplying cocaine .

Australian lawyer Julian McMahon referred to what he expects from a modern democracy when he described any attempt to end the pair's life before the appeal is heard as 'unthinkable'. 'Now if it turns out that my clients are moved from here to a place of execution while they are in the process of having an appeal heard in a court then that would be a shocking thing,' Mr McMahon said outside Kerobokan prison in Bali, according to a report by the Daily Telegraph. 'It’s unthinkable that people who are having their right to life litigated in a court can at the same time be taken away for that court by powerful people, such as the executive and simply executed.' Scroll down for video . Final journey: The strain shows on the faces of Myuran Sukumaran (left) and Andrew Chan (right), pictured in Kerobokan prison this week in Kerobokan prison with Indonesia's human rights commissioner Natalius Pigai (centre) who can do nothing to save them from execution which now seems set for this weekend . In waiting: Seen from the waters off Nuskambangan in central Java this is the police station on the 30km long island which houses seven prisons, including Batu or 'stone' prison where special isolation cells have been prepared for the Australian Bali 9 duo ahead of the deaths by firing squad . It had earlier been confirmed by the Indonesian Attorney General that any pending legal appeals will not delay the execution of the Bali Nine duo and the eight other drug smugglers. The news came as Bali's chief prosecutor Momock Bambang Samiarso announced Australian death row inmates Andrew Chan and Myuran Sukumaran will be moved to 'Death Island' where they will be executed this week. HM Prasetyo also confirmed that the preparations for the mass death by firing squad were '95 per cent' ready as Chan and Sukumaran's lawyers are planning to lodge an appeal within the next week. Grisly business: Dressed in civvies to play their roles as Myuran Sukumaran and Andrew Chan, two police officers from Indonesia's mobile brigade take part in a dress rehearsal for the men's removal to Nusakambangan island for their execution along with eight other drug traffickers . The two Australians have a 900km journey from Bali where they have lived for the last decade, west to the port town of Cilacap from where they will be transferred to the prison island and place of their execution, Nusakambangan . However, HM Prasetyo said following the clemency plea rejection there were no more 'no more legal avenues left', The Sydney Morning Herald reported. 'Regarding the transfer (of Chan and Sukumaran), it will be done as soon as possible,' he said. 'It's all related to technical issues. Maybe there are still some things that need to be prepared. As an Indonesian battleship is due to arrive in the waters off Nusakambangan island in southern central Java, Mr Samiarso said that for the first time Attorney General M. Prasetyo had issued him with an order to to move the Bali Nine duo to the island. Last rites: Kerobokan prison (pictured, this week) will hold a special Hindu ceremony for Chan and Sukumaran asking the gods to bless the men before they make their final journey to their deaths . Is all hope lost? Bali's chief prosecutor says he is now certain that Myuran Sukumaran (above, left) and Andrew Chan (right) will be moved from Bali to Nusakambangan Island this week to be out to the firing squad . A masked member of the mobile paramilitary brigade 'Brimob' armed with an assault rifle will be among 22 officers who will accompany Chan and Sukumaran from Kerobokan prison to Denpasar airport, which they last saw ten years ago on arrival for their ill-fated heroin smuggling trip . These armed personnel carriers belonging to the Indonesian special police will be used in the transfer of the two Australians to Bali's airport whereupon they will be placed in Sukhoi jets and likely flown straight to Cilacap, which is just a short trip to their place of execution, Nusakambangan . This comes as gruesome details of the planned executions comes to light. The two Australians and eight others will be executed in similar fashion to five foreigners and an Indonesian woman killed by firing squad on the island on January 18. Four of the  prisoners were strapped to wooden planks with a type of rubber used to make the inside of car tyres. Indonesian Rani Andriani aka Melisa Aprilia, opted not to be attached to a board, saying in a written submission beforehand 'submission does not mean give up. Do the best, God will finish the rest'. Indonesian police carry out an ant-terrorist drill at Pasir Putih prison, the 'supermax' of Nuskambangan's seven correctional facilities on the island where Chan and Sukumaran are due to be shot this week . After weeks of deadly anticipation it appears that Nusakambangan, where police were pictured (above) this week taking part in an anti-terrorist drill is finally ready to carry out the deaths by firing squad of ten drug traffickers including the Australians Chan and Sukumaran . Indonesia plans to  hold the Australians and eight other convicted drug traffickers in one of the island's prisons before they are simultaneously killed by firing squads in the middle of the night. The prisons boss for Central java provence, Ahmad Yuspahruddin,confirmed last week that special isolation cells had been prepared for the Australian pair or Batu, or 'stone' prison away from the jail's other inmates weho weren't on death row. The transfer of Chan and Sukumaran to Nusakambangan, which had been predicted more than a week ago, was delayed by the logistics of carrying out the execution of ten people at once. Myuran Sukumaran pictured in 2006 just after the death sentence had been passed on him and Andrew Chan, less than a year after the pair and the seven drug mules they consigned to carry 8.3kg of heroin into Australia had been caught and jailed . The men spent time with family members, although Sukumaran's father, Sam and siblings, brother Chinthu and sister Brinthe returned to Australia on Sunday. Andrew Chan, 31, and Myuran Sukumaran, 34, were the leaders of an 8.3kg heroin trafficking ring dubbed the 'Bali 9' who were convicted of attempting to smuggle the drugs out of Indonesia to Australia in 2005. They were sentenced to death in February 2006 and have been living in Kerobokan prison. The other eight due to face the firing squad are: Filipina Mary Jane Fiesta Veloso, Nigerian Raheem Agbaje Salami, Serge Areski Atlaoui of France, Martin Anderson of Ghana, Indonesian Zainal Abidin, Silvester Obikwe of Nigeria and Rodrigo Gularte, a paranoid schizophrenic man from Brazil whose family has desperately fought to be transferred to a hospital.","Lawyers beg for more time so appeal can be heard before executions .

The porn star flashes parts of her body repeatedly while on a coach trip to the tourist destination. Speaking to the camera, the woman called Aurita complains about the views. The actress called Aurita is filmed walking around the pyramids, pictured with a cameraman . During the ten-minute long trailer, the actress constantly complains about having to visit the sites . As tourists look at the historic sites, the porn actress takes the opportunity to flash her cameraman . Driving past the pyramids, the 'actress' claims 'this f****** sucks. What is there to look at?' 'It really sucks, even our resorts are better.' Next, she holds up a an ornamental cat which came from a souvenir stall. She told the camera man: 'First he wanted ten bucks. I told him I won't buy it. I said I know where to get them for three bucks. Then he agreed three bucks'. Once out at the pyramids, she points to one in the distance and said: 'Look, it's unfinished.' When an Egyptian man approaches she tells him 'I don't want to ride on a camel.' Her camera man suggests that she pays the man, she replies: 'I don't want to give him a dollar.' The actress appears on the trailer wearing a tight pair of blue hotpants and a yellow top. She continually flashes various parts of her body towards the camera, even with fellow tourists in the background. When her cameraman asked her to stand beside the Sphynx, she claimed: 'I don't want to stand here. We've already filmed it.' The actress tells viewers that one of the pyramids looks as if it's unfinished and sounds bored by the tour . She also said that the tourist resorts 'back home' are better claiming 'what is there to look at?' The movie culminates in graphic pornographic scenes involving the actress and a male co-star. According to a report on Newstime Africa Egyptian authorities have been angered by the graphic film which features several iconic locations around Giza and Cairo. Antiquities Minister Mamdouh al-Damati said: 'A set of sexually explicit scenes was illegally filmed inside the Giza Necropolis by a foreign tourist while visiting the site.' He confirmed that prosecuting authorities are studying the movie Al-Damati said the incident had since been referred to prosecutors for investigation. The woman and her cameraman followed unsuspecting holidaymakers on a guided tour of the ancient sites . The woman even complained about having to pay $3 for an ornamental cat, pictured,  from a street vendor . Egyptian authorities have launched a probe after a porno actress filmed a movie around the Pyramids . The company behind the movie released a ten-minute teaser video on the internet, introducing the the actress, who is believed to be Russian. Initially Egyptian authorities claimed the movie had been faked, but now they have reversed their decision. However, Egyptologists have branded the movies 'demeaning' and said the government should act to prevent its further distribution due to the effect it will have on Egyptian culture. Bassam al-Shamaa said: 'Surveillance cameras aren’t enough to secure such important sites. A full security cordon must be installed to prevent such incidents – which demean Egyptian civilisation – from reoccurring. 'If camera records confirm the filming of this video, the antiquities minister and the relevant security personnel should resign.'","Egyptian authorities have launched a probe into a new porn movie .

A 52-year-old builder has been charged with murder following the discovery of a woman's body at a flat. Officers found the body of Sarah Pollock, 41, in her flat in the Springbourne area of Bournemouth, Dorset, at 3.26pm on March 25. Her colleagues raised the alarm when she failed to open the shop she was working for at the Dolphin Centre in Poole. A post-mortem examination found Miss Pollock died as a result of strangulation and severe stab wounds to the neck. Builder Colin Dymond, 52, from Bournemouth, who was known to Miss Pollock, was today charged with her murder. He will appear before Bournemouth Magistrates' Court tomorrow. Detective Inspector Mark Samuel, of Dorset Police, said: 'Family liaison officers have updated Sarah's family with this development and the thoughts of the investigation team are with her loved ones. 'Clearly this is a very difficult time for the whole family and they have requested privacy. 'I would also like to thank local people who have been patient and assisted police, particularly some of the residents of Avon Close who have been temporarily relocated. 'Their understanding and co-operation has helped us conduct a thorough investigation into this tragic matter as swiftly as possible.' At 3.26pm on Wednesday, March 25, Dorset police found the body of the 41-year-old in her flat in Avon Close in the Springbourne area after concerns were raised that she had not arrived at work as expected . Miss Pollock's body was formally identified by family members, who are being supported by police family liaison officers. Mr Samuel appealed for the public's help to trace the movements of a Peugeot 308 estate hire care with the registration HN14 HWC. 'Although we have charged a man with murder we still want to hear from members of the public if they have any information that could help with the investigation into Sarah's death,' he said. 'We have now recovered the Peugeot hire car from the London area and I am interested if anyone saw it being driven or parked in Dorset or Hampshire between 4pm on Tuesday 24 March and 10pm on Wednesday 25 March 2015. If so, please call Dorset Police urgently. 'We are still building a picture of exactly what happened to Sarah. If anyone saw or heard anything suspicious in the Avon Close area of Bournemouth or has any other information that could be useful, I would urge them to please get in touch.' In a statement, Miss Pollock's family said: 'We have lost an important part of our lives; a kind, caring, honest, outgoing and ultimately indescribable daughter, sister and auntie from our close-knit family. 'She was unforgettable and she will always remain in our hearts and minds, although she should not be gone. 'We respectfully ask that we are left to grieve without intrusion and want to thank Dorset Police for their hard work so far in helping our distraught family.'

c93ef8166fd7485f100f4bf32f5f0e708cf1741b,"(CNN)As the seventh full week of testimony in the first-degree murder trial against former New England Patriots star Aaron Hernandez came to a close this week, witnesses described him as acting strangely and glaring at the victim two nights before the killing. Hernandez is on trial in Fall River, Massachusetts, in connection with the shooting death of Odin Lloyd, a semi-pro football player who was found dead June 17, 2013. The former tight end had signed a five-year contract extension worth $40 million but, less than a year later, Hernandez was charged with the murder of the man who was dating the sister of his fiancée. Hours after his arrest on June 26, 2013, the Patriots dropped him from the team. Two of Hernandez's closest associates are co-defendants in the case. Evidence collected in Lloyd's death led to two more murder charges against Hernandez in a separate case in Boston. He is accused of shooting Daniel de Abreu and Safiro Furtado in July 2012, allegedly over a spilled drink. Two witnesses who saw Hernandez at the Boston nightclub Rumor just 48 hours before Lloyd's killing said he looked angry and aggressive. Lloyd was with Hernandez at the club that Friday night. On Thursday, prosecutors called witness No. 100: Kasey Arma, a nightclub promoter. She told jurors she danced with Aaron Hernandez at the club in the early morning of June 15, 2013. Hernandez approached her. ""He walked by me and he tapped my hip."" Arma testified that she danced with Hernandez for about 10 minutes. ""He was pleasant and kind of charming,"" she said. Then he left abruptly. When he returned about 10 minutes later, Arma said, Hernandez grabbed her arm and took her to another part of the club. His demeanor changed. He was ""very aggressive,"" she testified. Then, she said, he asked her ""to show what I could do with that thing,"" referring to her backside. ""He was irritated and very aggressive,"" she told the jury. During cross-examination, defense attorney Michael Fee showed surveillance video of Arma dancing with Hernandez. There was bumping and grinding, mostly with her backside to him. It was uncomfortable to watch in court. Jurors watched the video with laser focus. Fee asked Arma, ""What kind of dance is that called?"" Arma said she didn't know. Some of the female jurors appeared to chuckle softly. Earlier in the week, witness Kwami Nicholas testified that he also saw Hernandez at Rumor and the ex-player ""seemed like he was angry about something."" Hernandez's mouth looked like a ""grunt,"" he said. Nicholas, a college student, was at the club with friends -- some of whom were friends with Lloyd. When Lloyd was talking closely with one of his friends, Hernandez looked angry, according to Nicholas. Hernandez was standing near the DJ at the time, about 15 feet away from Lloyd and his friend. Nicholas said Hernandez glared at them for a few minutes. During tough questioning from Fee, Nicholas stood his ground. The defense showed jurors Nicholas' initial recorded interview with detectives in which he gave a different description of what he saw and was less critical of Hernandez. Nicholas also remembered Hernandez ""storming out of the club."" ""He looked angry,"" Nicholas told the jury. As Hernandez walked down the street, ""he motioned back with his arms as if to say get away from me."" Prosecutors played surveillance video backing up Nicholas' description. During that video, Lloyd is also seen following Hernandez at a distance. Though prosecutors are trying to establish that Hernandez was angry, jurors still don't know why. Shayanna Jenkins, Hernandez's fiancée and mother of his baby daughter, was not in court to see the dirty-dancing video. She hasn't been seen in court since March 6. But Jenkins' name did come up in court regarding a defense motion to suppress evidence gathered from Hernandez's house in November 2014. Jurors were not present for that debate. The prosecution showed before-and-after photos of a closet in Hernandez's home in North Attleboro. One photo from June 2013 showed the sneakers Hernandez wore the night Lloyd was killed. It also showed the shoes Hernandez associate Carlos Ortiz wore the same night. The two pairs of shoes rested on top of a bunch of other shoes. In the second photo, taken in November 2014, the same closet is seen with all of the shoes except the ones Hernandez and Ortiz were wearing the night of the shooting. They were no longer in the closet or any other part of the house. Prosecutors wanted to link Jenkins to the disappearance of the shoes. McCauley referred to the defendant's jailhouse comments that ""she does what I want,"" referring to Jenkins. McCauley also told the judge that Hernandez ""was directing her (Jenkins) to give money to Tanya Singleton at the time where he had just recently told her not to talk."" He added, ""We know she didn't talk and then was held in contempt."" Tanya Singleton is Hernandez's cousin. Court observers wonder when Jenkins will be back. The last time Jenkins was in court, a reporter noticed she was no longer wearing her engagement ring. However, Jenkins is facing perjury charges for allegedly lying to investigators and has been granted immunity to testify at the trial. Will testimony about Hernandez's liaisons with other women -- and negative texts about Jenkins -- affect her testimony? Does her absence mean she'll turn on her fiance? The answers may be a few weeks away. There are indications the Commonwealth may wrap up its case by mid-April, . Much testimony focused on the shoes Hernandez wore the night Lloyd was shot. A Nike consultant testified that Hernandez was wearing Nike Air Jordan Retro 11 Lows in a size 13. About 93,000 pairs of that shoe were made, significantly fewer in a size 13. The shoe's sole makes a distinct impression, according to Lt. Steven Bennett of the Massachusetts State Police. The consultant testified under questioning from defense attorney Jamie Sultan that other Nike shoes-- more than 3 million -- make the same impression . Yet Bennett, who works in crime scene services, testified that the footwear impression left near Lloyd's body was ""in agreement"" or consistent with the Air Jordan Retro 11 Lows size 13. Although he did not have the shoes that Hernandez wore that night, he an identical pair to make his determination.  Bennett did so by creating a transparency of the sole and laying it over a photo of the footwear impression. Jurors watched as he drew lines showing how the sole aligned with the impression. What may have been a key moment for the prosecution was quickly derailed by defense attorney Jamie Sultan. Sultan questioned the science behind analyzing foot impressions, and he introduced a March 2014 report from Bennett saying the partial footwear impression lacked certain detail and quality to make a comparison. Sultan hammered Bennett on that report. Bennett admitted that his reexamination helped the prosecution. McCauley was able to undo some of the damage, allowing Bennett to explain that it was only after gaining access to Air Jordan Retro 11s  in December 2014 that he was able to make a comparison. He testified that what he thought was a lack of distinction were actually gaps in the design of the sole. It's clear from the testimony and the filing for a search warrant in November 2014 that investigators overlooked the shoes worn by Hernandez, Ortiz and Ernest Wallace -- another co-defendant -- the night of Lloyd's death, despite having a photo of them from June 2013. Seventeen months into the investigation, they searched Hernandez's house again. None of the shoes were found. The prosecution brought in three separate witnesses who either owned or worked for companies in the industrial park along John Dietsch Boulevard where Lloyd's body was found. With these witnesses and collected surveillance videos, prosecutors gave jurors a road map of the route they say Hernandez drove to the Corliss Landing crime scene. While the car's make and model aren't distinguishable in the video, jurors could see its lights go by at specific times that match when Hernandez, Wallace, Ortiz and Lloyd would have been in the car. Tanya Singleton arranged for her aunt to drive her and Wallace to Georgia in the days after Lloyd's death. Testifying for the prosecution, Euna Ritchon said Singleton asked her on June 21, 2013, to move up her planned trip to visit her daughter in Georgia. She brought Wallace with her. At the time, Singleton was married to Ritchon's nephew, TL Singleton. He died in a car crash a little more than a week later. Ritchon also testified that Wallace suggested using back roads to drive out of Connecticut and through New York to avoid tolls. She said Wallace carried his clothes in a black trash bag. Prosecutors were attempting to get jurors to link it to the black trash bag Shayanna Jenkins removed from her house just a few days earlier. Prosecutors say that bag held the gun used to kill Lloyd. After spending the night at the home of Ritchon's daughter, Wallace boarded a bus to Florida. That's where he surrendered to police. Wallace has pleaded not guilty to the charge of an accessory after the fact of a slaying in Lloyd's death.","Aaron Hernandez on trial for the 2013 death of Odin Lloyd .

db686be72d79433c1b173c62a79c85702dfbea83,"England will unleash their 'special' force of nature, Courtney Lawes, against Scotland at Twickenham on Saturday to add clout and dynamism up front following the crushing loss to Ireland. Northampton's 26-year-old lock returns to the starting XV as one of two changes from the setback in Dublin which dashed hopes of a Grand Slam for yet another year. The other sees Harlequins full back Mike Brown reinstated as Stuart Lancaster announced his line-up on Wednesday for the latest installment of an increasingly one-sided Calcutta Cup rivalry. Courtney Lawes will make a welcome return for England against Scotland at Twickenham on Saturday . Backs: M Brown (Harlequins); A Watson (Bath), J Joseph (Bath), L Burrell (Northampton), J Nowell (Exeter); G Ford (Bath), B Youngs (Leicester) Forwards: J Marler (Harlequins), D Hartley (Northampton), D Cole (Leicester); D Attwood (Bath), C Lawes (Northampton); J Haskell (Wasps), B Vunipola (Saracens), C Robshaw (Harlequins, C) Subs: T Youngs (Leicester), M Vunipola (Saracens), K Brookes (Newcastle), G Parling (Leicester), T Wood (Northampton), R Wigglesworth (Saracens), D Cipriani (Sale), B Twelvetrees (Gloucester) Lawes will add clout and dynamism up front to Stuart Lancaster's side reeling from their loss to Ireland . Head coach Lancaster said: 'There's always a lot of competition for places and having experienced players like Courtney, Tom and Geoff available after playing well for their clubs in the last few weeks adds to our options. 'It's been an intense two weeks of training as everyone wants to be on that field on Saturday and we've had to make some tough selection calls.' Lawes will win his 37th Test cap against the Scots, having proved his fitness with the Saints after being out for two months with an ankle injury. Two comeback club matches have been enough to convince the England management that he is primed to reignite their championship campaign. Reuniting Lawes with Dave Attwood in the second row means George Kruis of Saracens is out of the match-day 23, for the time being. Having dipped against Ireland after storming displays in the wins over Wales and Italy, the rookie has made way, with Leicester's Lion, Geoff Parling, coming on to the bench along with flanker Tom Wood - another back from injury - and prop Kieran Brookes. Full back Mike Brown will also be back when Lancaster announces his side on Wednesday . Brown takes part in full training at Bagshot on Tuesday as England prepare for the Calcutta Cup . Forwards coach Graham Rowntree said: 'Courtney is a special player. He's been good for us. He's really maturing as a player and as a person. You can't hide what he can bring for us physically. I've watched his last two games for Northampton and he's played well. This time last year, on the summer tour and in the autumn series, he played exceptionally well and he's back to his best. 'We've got a lot of athletes in the second row. I've been very pleased with the progress of the guys who have been performing in the absence of Courtney and Geoff over the last few months. But we have a lot of riches in that area now.' For many years, Lawes has been acclaimed for his destructive impact as a tackler and athletic ball-carrier but Rowntree insisted he is equally adept at doing the unglamorous duties required from a tight forward. Lawes reunites with Dave Attwood while Geoff Parling (pictured) comes back onto the bench . Flanker Tom Wood (pictured) also returns from injury, as will prop Kieran Brookes . 'He is capable of the 'grunt' work,' he said. 'That area of his game has significantly improved, his work-rate. That's what you get with Courtney: high work-rate but also a lot of stand-out moments.' The reshuffle of the impressive lock stocks extends to a recall for Parling as a replacement after the first half of his season was disrupted by concussion. He has forged a reputation as a supreme lineout operator but Rowntree also paid tribute to his carrying efforts in recent seasons, and his leadership as an experienced figure who was a mainstay of the Lions' success in Australia in 2013. Forwards coach Graham Rowntree describes Lawes as 'a special player' for what he brings physically . Rowtree expects a high work-rate along with some stand-out moments from Lawes on Saturday . England's defeat in Dublin was notable as a rare off-day for captain Chris Robshaw, who had been leading the side with increasing authority of late. Rowntree didn't duck the fact that the skipper needs to raise his game again. 'I've been happy with Chris this last six months,' he said. 'He did well in the autumn, against Leinster too, injured his shoulder then came back to be outstanding against Wales. He played well against Italy but, among a lot of other guys, did not have his best game in Ireland against a very good outfit in terms of breakdown and set-piece. Chris Robshaw had a rare off day against Ireland but Rowntree expects the England skipper to bounce back . 'We have had frank reviews and I'm sure we will have a reaction from Chris this week. This group are very good at putting their hands up. Chris leads that. One of his greatest qualities is his honesty.' Robshaw acknowledged the collective need to lift standards back up to where they were in Cardiff. He will be hoping Wales scupper Irish Grand Slam hopes before trying to deal with the expectation of a resounding home win against Scotland. 'There are different pressures,' he said. 'We're favourites going into that game at home. 'You want to deliver and set the standard of how you want to play. Hopefully we win, but hopefully we do it in the right manner.'","Courtney Lawes returns for his 37th England cap against Scotland .

The Irish trainer would have won it with Annie Power had she not stumbled at the final fence and thrown off Ruby Walsh but still ended up lifting the prize with stablemate Glens Melody. That makes it seven wins running, Mullins having lifted the prize for the last six seasons with another record-breaker in Quevega before she retired to stud. Glens Melody capitalises on Annie Power's fall to win the OLBG Mares’ Hurdle . It will be a shame if Mullins’ total domination of day one overshadows the first Festival win of trainer Neil Mulholland courtesy of The Druids Nephew in the Ultima Business Solutions Handicap Chase. Mulholland, who runs The Young Master in this afternoon’s RSA Chase, is a trainer going places and now has the Grand National in his sights for The Druids Nephew, who won under Barry Geraghty. There was no redemption for last year’s unlucky Champion Hurdle third The New One, who could only manage fifth this time around. Jockey Sam Twiston-Davies was adamant that his mount was not himself, describing the feel he gave him as ‘not like him’. His father trainer Nigel will begin a retrieval mission next week but I wonder if Tuesday’s run means The New One will be over fences next season. Jockey Sam Twiston-Davies (above) was adamant that his mount The New One was not himself . Irish trainer Gordon Elliott is more established than Neil Mulholland but his efforts in plotting a route back to the Festival with his National Hunt Chase winner Cause of Causes also deserves praise. The gelding was second at the meeting last year and had run only three times since with his novice status preserved. Elliott also set up a 64th birthday winner for owner JP McManus. The final race of day one now has the less than snappy name of the CHAPS Restaurant Barbados Novices’ Handicap Chase. Quite a mouthful but Welsh trainer Rebecca Curtis is hoping that might work in her favour after Irish Cavalier won for owner Andrew McIver and gave jockey Paul Townend his second win of the day. Admitting she had never visited the island, Curtis said: ‘Maybe Andrew will take me there now.’","Glens Melody makes it seven wins running in OLBG Mares’ Hurdle .

3d445327b792cfb1ae18021780b5cb9d1c84d61e,"FA chairman Greg Dyke has described as ‘pretty scary’ the increase in disciplinary cases brought against players surrounding referees to try to influence decisions. Dyke was speaking out a week after Chelsea’s Champions League defeat by Paris Saint-Germain during which nine Chelsea players crowded around the Dutch referee Bjorn Kuipers following Zlatan Ibrahimovic’s challenge on Oscar which resulted in the Swedish talisman being sent off. The FA clampdown on such incidents has seen an increase in clubs in the top five divisions – from the Premier League to the Conference - charged with 'surrounding match officials' (three or more players from one club approach a match official in a confrontational manner) from six last season to 16 with another three months of the campaign still to go. John Terry, Cesc Fabregas and their Chelsea team-mates surround referee Bjorn Kuipers . All nine outfield Chelsea players remonstrate with Kuipers as Oscar is left in a heap on the floor . Warnings or reminders are also up from 23 last campaign to 29 during 2014-2015. Dyke said: 'We have seen a pretty scary increase this season in the number of clubs charged with their players surrounding referees. As a result we have written to the clubs in the top five divisions reminding them of the rules and their responsibilities. 'I believe it is particularly important for professional cubs to set an example so that this kind of conduct is not replicated at grassroots and youth level. The whole game needs to ensure it is addressing this issue.’ The rapid increase in FA charges follows not only the December letter sent to 116 teams but also visits to clubs last summer when this issue was raised directly with players who were told that it would not be tolerated. Zlatan Ibrahimovic was sent off for his challenge which provoked an aggressive reaction from Chelsea . Chelsea captain John Terry moved to defend his side's actions during their clash against Paris Saint-Germain . The FA will now look at heavier fines than the current sliding scale of costs from £20,000-£500 or other options to address the worrying upward curve in harassing the match officials. Referees could also start to be more proactive themselves by showing yellow cards to the players surrounding them, which is within their powers. Ironically, considering that the Chelsea players' distasteful conduct brought this issue to the fore, UEFA do not have a similar charge in their rulebook. Chelsea captain John Terry admitted after the PSG match that the willingness to surround referees ‘doesn’t look good’. But Terry was adamant they would continue to do so if they believe opponents - such as PSG – are attempting to exert their own influence on the match officials. Terry said: 'For me, if I have to run 20, 30 yards, it doesn’t look great, but when you’re standing back and seeing five or six of their players surrounding the ref... for me, I think I support my team-mates. 'And once I go, four or five go with me. It doesn’t look good at all, but that’s part of the game.'","Greg Dyke was speaking a week after Chelsea's defeat against PSG .

c64f6c3c728e94ef81920288d1280ad115257595,"So was The New One the unluckiest horse at last year’s Cheltenham Festival? Twelve months of wondering should finally be answered at around half past three on Tuesday afternoon. The ground the gelding surrendered when hampered by the fatal fall of Our Conor at the third flight seemed crucial at the time. But were we all conned by the final-furlong surge that he conjured under jockey Sam Twiston-Davies to grab third place behind Jezki and My Tent Or Yours, just in front of dual winner Hurricane Fly in fourth? Sam Twiston-Davies has unfinished business in Monday's big race at Cheltenham . Twiston-Davies  riding The New One on the way to victory in the StanJames.com Champion Hurdle Trial . Jezki and Hurricane Fly, who have traded punches all winter across the Irish Sea, are back again. They have been joined by Hurricane Fly’s unbeaten stablemate Faugheen, christened ‘The Machine’ because of the stunning visual nature of his performances. Significantly, he is also the choice of stable jockey Ruby Walsh. Together they make up one of the strongest ever Irish assaults on the Stan James Champion Hurdle. Britain can muster only three runners and two of them, Bertimont and Vaniteux, are rank outsiders. With hopes resting on the shoulders of the 22-year-old Twiston-Davies and the gelding trained by his father Nigel — and with the Irish wave advancing — Sam could be forgiven if he felt like Michael Caine in the film Zulu. However, he is totally focused on exorcising last year’s nightmare experience. It was one which prompted an enduring image of the 2014 Festival, the crest-fallen Sam with his head in his hands. Back in 2013 Ireland outscored Great Britain by winning 14 of the 27 races, the first time in Festival history that the Irish have won the majority of the races. Great Britain was back on top last year (15-12) but face a strong challenge this time, with five of Tuesday’s races containing favourites from across the water. Ireland dominates the betting for the feature Champion Hurdle, with The New One an island of red, white and blue amid the green, white and orange of the main contenders. Twiston-Davies is entirely focused on exorcising last year's nightmare experience . If the hot four favourites trained by Willie Mullins and ridden by Ruby Walsh all win on Tuesday, bookmakers claim they could be facing their worst day since Frankie Dettori’s Magnificent Seven at Ascot in 1996, which cost them £40million. The Irish duo struck twice on opening day last year and team up this time with Douvan in the Supreme Novices’ Hurdle, Un De Sceaux in the Arkle Chase, Faugheen in the Champion Hurdle and Annie Power in the OLBG Mares’ Hurdle. Coral’s Dave Stevens said: ‘If all four win it will be our worst day in Festival history. They are bound to be popular and linked in accumulators.’ Sam says: ‘There are loads of different opinions and I’d love to know what the answer is. I have watched the video hundreds of times. ‘It is one of the hardest things I have had to deal with. I had run the race scenario through my head so many times and that was the only one I had not thought of. ‘I was prepared for anything else — to finish second or even to fall off. To see him finish as strongly as he did, if things had gone his way he could have won. Luckily, the owners were very kind. They did not make me hang around (in the unsaddling enclosure) afterwards. We talked about what had happened on another day. ‘I just wanted to sit down and put a towel over my head in the weighing room. ‘The only certainty is that I am now able to deal with defeat and disappointment better than I was. That is the experience of growing up.’ Since last year’s Champion Hurdle, The New One has won all of his five races, four of them this season. He gained plaudits for his impressive victory in Cheltenham’s International Hurdle in December but was less impressive when being forced to dig deeper than expected by Bertimont in his final prep at Haydock. But Sam says that is not a concern, adding: ‘I wouldn’t say we have drawn a line through Haydock because we learned that he doesn’t want heavy ground. He would not run on it that bad again. ‘We also learned when things are not going right he is able to win from a bad situation. We now know if it was a dogfight in the Champion he could cope. I loved his performance in the International Hurdle. It was spectacular. He jumped the last upsides and put four lengths between him and Vaniteux.’ Twiston-Davies says he is now able to deal with defeat and disappointment much better . Victory on Tuesday afternoon would be made even more satisfying given the familial nature of the challenge. Since last year’s meeting, Sam, whose two Festival winners include The New One in the 2013 Neptune Investment Novices’ Hurdle, has been appointed stable jockey to champion trainer Paul Nicholls, the best job in jump racing. It means a string of good rides lined up this week, including Vibrato Valtat in this afternoon’s Arkle Trophy and Saphir Du Rheu in Thursday’s World Hurdle. But he admits he does not know if he would have accepted such riding riches had he been made to leave the star in his father’s stable behind. ‘It’s a very interesting question and I could not give an answer,’ Sam says. ‘I have been lucky to win a lot of big races but The New One is spectacular — one of the best I have ever ridden. ‘He is massive. Dad’s big chance of the week. To do it as a family would be a dream. He goes there in good form. ‘I just hope last year wasn’t supposed to be his year.’","The New One and Sam Twiston-Davies looking to avenge last year's defeat .

They were on duty in South L.A., when gunfire erupted in the early evening, grazing both of them, said Officer Cory Meisner. They both sustained minor injuries and were treated at the scene. One of the officers had to have bullet fragments removed from his arm later, according to the LAPD. The Los Angeles Times reported that the officers had been driving through the neighborhood dressed in plain clothes. The officers returned fire, and several suspects scattered, Det.

8b77ab96321cb5873b82082970a771ca344f3861,"There are only two places on earth where  tectonic plates are visible above sea level: Kenya's Rift Valley, and in the south west of Iceland. On Mount Hengill, an active lava field, just outside Þingvellir National Park, the striking ION hotel stands on a craggy outcrop close to where the North American and Eurasian plates meet, drifting further and further apart, each year. Boiling water bubbles just 25ft underground here, so when it was built on the site of a geothermal power plant, its creators had to use building materials seven times stronger than standard materials used in Reykjavík. The striking ION Hotel is situated on Mount Hengill,  an active volcano whose last eruption was around 2,000 years ago . The 45-room hotel is an extension and renovation of the old workers' quarters of the Nesjavellir geothermal power station,  bought  in 2011, with the intention of being the only hotel in this isolated - and beautiful - part of the country. ION makes use of Iceland's unique geography in two ways: the biothermal energy is harnessed in a spectacular outdoor natural hot spring; and a glass building - the Northern Lights Bar - allows guests to admire the frequent aurora borealis displays. Owner Sigurlaug Sverrisdóttir, who was born and raised in the region, knows all too about extreme weather, and said the Northern Lights never get old. She says: 'This respect for Mother Nature is in our blood; our parents and grandparents certainly knew not to mess with her. One month before I was born, in January 1973, there was an eruption on the Westman Island, a small island south of Iceland. A glass extension to the building - the Northern Lights Bar - allows guests to admire the frequent aurora borealis displays . ION is surrounded by natural hot springs, which provide geothermal hot water and energy to the hotel's own natural outdoor pool . Rooms at the ION hotel start at  £184 (bed and breakfast) Go Green offer tours green and sustainable tours of Iceland . For flights, see icelandair.co.uk . 'Overnight almost the entire island was covered in lava. The rescue to move the islanders to the mainland was successful mainly due to the fact that all of the fishing boats were in harbour as these as were too rough for the locals to fish. 'The first boat left with habitants to reach the mainland only 30 minutes after the volcano erupted. Even though I was born here, I’m still fascinated about the lava, moss landscape around ION. 'I still feel amazed when I see the Northern Lights dancing in the sky on one of my late returns from work. Even though you have experienced it several times before it is different when you are outside of the city, it's much more intense. The Northern Lights bar  has floor-to-ceiling glass windows on three sides, making it the perfect vantage point for watching aurora borealis . Inside,  there's a modern, natural  aesthetic created by Icelandic wool throws, Icelandic art, and flower vases, hand-blown by local artists . 'I also thrive from the energy; I find immense power in the Icelandic nature. Hence the reason we chose ION for the hotel's name.' Everything about the hotel screams Iceland. Inside, lava, reclaimed wood and Icelandic wool are used to furnish rooms, bathroom products are made from Icelandic herbs and everything from the bed linen to the restaurant is organic and fair trade, in line with the island's strong emphasis on preserving its natural beauty. To experience the tectonic plates up close, the hotel offers snorkelling and diving trips to Silfra, the world's most easily accessible tectonic fissure, where visibility exceeds 330ft. It is here that you can touch the continents of America and Europe at the same time. Among the moss and lava: The ION hotel is designed to make use of and complement its rugged and beautiful surroundings . The restaurant - aiming to be Iceland's first with a Michelin star - serves up such delicacies such as reindeer, onions, spruce and bone marrow, smoked bone marrow ice cream, sea buckthorn and malt molasses and Icelandic langoustine, locally caught Arctic char and skyr (homemade yoghurt). Venturing into the wilderness, guests are offered a range of activities from horse riding in mountains around Öflus, fly fishing on Lake Þingvellir, Sólheimajökull glacier tours, rafting and hot spring hikes. As well as excursions to the Golden Circle -  south Iceland's most famous sightseeing route, which includes the waterfall Gullfoss and the geothermally active valley of Haukadalur, containing the  Strokkur geyser  - which erupts every five to 10 minutes, guaranteeing an 'ooh' or an 'ahh' from an ever captive audience.

Spieth won a three-way play-off with a 28-foot birdie on the third extra hole to become only the fourth player since 1940 to win twice on the PGA Tour before turning 22. It is a feat that not even McIlroy mastered with Tiger Woods, Sergio Garcia and Robert Gamez the only players to have achieved that particular accolade in the past 75 years. But it is the Northern Irishman that is within Spieth's focus heading towards Augusta. ""I like studying the game, being a historian of the game,"" Spieth told the PGA Tour website. ""It's really cool to have my name go alongside those. ""But right now currently what I'm really focused on is Rory McIlroy and the No.1 in the world. That's who everyone is trying to chase. ""That's our ultimate goal to eventually be the best in the world and this is a great, great stepping stone. But going into the four majors of the year, to have closed one out in this kind of fashion is going to give me a lot of confidence."" Spieth has long been heralded as the next big thing in golf -- shining in the amateur ranks with two U.S. junior titles and leading last year's Masters after the third round before eventually finishing tied for second, three shots behind Bubba Watson. On Sunday, he held his nerve at the Innisbrook Resort in Palm Harbor, Florida, to hold on for the victory. He first rescued par on the 16th with a 60-foot bunker shot and needed a 32-foot putt to ensure his place in the playoff, which he duly holed. It was a putt of similar length that ensured a second Tour win to add to his John Deere Classic success in July 2013, which he also won courtesy of a playoff making him the youngest PGA Tour winner for 82 years at the time.","Jordan Spieth only the fourth player since 1940 to seal two PGA Tour wins under age of 22 .

Ewan Potter was kicked and punched in the playground of Living Faith Lutheran Primary School at Murrumba Downs in Brisbane's north two weeks ago. He was left with some 'cracking bruises' and clear psychological effects, but his father Anthony says the young boys responsible got away with just a slap on the wrist. Ewan Potter was kicked and punched in the playground of Living Faith Lutheran Primary School at Murrumba Downs in Brisbane's north two weeks ago . Mr Potter was told by the school the group of boys - aged five and six - organised for the on-duty teacher to be distracted so they could carry out the attack on February 26. 'Ewan told me he was tricked into playing with the boys. They lured him behind the building and when he tried to run away they chased him and caught him,' Mr Potter told Daily Mail Australia. 'They dragged him back and started kicking and punching. 'The bruises are still there on his knees. He had a couple on his arms and chest. Luckily he didn't have any broken bones or blood gushing out.' His parents were only notified of the incident several hours after it happened because the school tried to sort out the situation using a method known as 'restorative practice'. 'They made Ewan go back to face all five boys so they could see what the bullying had done to him - how traumatic is that?' he said. 'He went to sleep that night with a stick to protect himself. I sat on the floor of his bedroom.' Ewan was left with some 'cracking bruises' and clear psychological effects, but his father Anthony (right) says the young boys responsible got away with just a slap on the wrist . Ewan, pictured here with his sister, was kicked and punched behind a school building by five young boys . Four of the boys remained in the same class with Ewan the next day, while the little boy who admitted to being 'the boss of the group' was moved to another classroom. 'It's gang violence. I can't believe six-year-olds can be pre-meditating attacks like this. One admitted to being the boss and getting four others involved,' Mr Potter said. The parents of all five children were called in and given behavioural orders  to work on at home, while age-appropriate consequences were enforced at school. Principal Jane Mueller said the school  had taken swift action and were 'saddened' by the bullying. 'I fully understand the concerns of parents of any child impacted by such an incident, and by the same token, I'm also conscious of our responsibility to teach these very young students at the infancy of their school career what is right and wrong,' she told the Courier Mail. Ewan's parents were only notified of the incident several hours after it happened because the school tried to sort out the situation using a method known as 'restorative practice' Ms Mueller said  the boys involved were still being monitored in the playground and consequences were being implemented at home with the support of parents. 'No matter what these parents do at home to help them, these kids have got away with a slap on the wrist. If we keep letting them get away with violence, how is it going to stop,' Mr Potter said. 'For my own child's safety I have to rely on other parents to take a proactive approach.' Mr Potter said he was hesitant to take Ewan back to school the day after he was bullied but didn't want him to fear it altogether. 'I just sat him down and told him what they did was wrong. I still sit there asking if he's okay. He's been really quiet and shut down. 'I don't know how much it's going to affect him. I still can't believe it happened.'","Ewan Potter was attacked by classmates at Brisbane school last month .

Eliza was found dead in a dumpster near the Mexican border the following day. During the kidnapping, a man burst into the Delacruz family home and shot the infant's parents and uncle before taking the girl. Scroll down for video . Theses sketches show the woman and man being sought in connection to the abduction of Eliza Delacruz . Eliza was found dead in a dumpster the day after a man broke into her home and shot her parents and uncle . She was found in a trash bin behind a pizza restaurant in Imperial Beach, a town near the Mexican border . Sketches were released on Wednesday of both suspects. The girl's parents and uncle were critically injured, but once they recovered the mother recalled her encounter with the woman. Authorities do not think the baby's father and uncle were followed before the shooting and kidnapping. Police say the woman was driving a black Range Rover SUV and that she stopped the mother and spoke to her about her infant after they got off the bus. About two hours later, Eliza was kidnapped by the gun-toting man. She was found dead the following day in a trash bin behind a pizza restaurant 120 miles south of her home in the town of Imperial Beach. Cameras did not capture a license plate of the SUV. The FBI is assisting to see if the images can be enhanced. According to the Long Beach Police Department: 'Detectives continue to consider all possibilities as to why these crimes may have occurred. 'At this point in the investigation, a connection between the victims and suspects has yet to be identified.' Police have not determined a motive and have no indication the family was in any kind of trouble. Police say the woman was driving a black Range Rover SUV (pictured) and that she spoke to the mother . A small memorial was created near the location of the trash bin where Eliza's dead body was dumped . Imperial Beach is about 120 miles away from the home Eliza was kidnapped from in Long Beach, California . Long Beach police Lt. Lloyd Cox said: 'We've looked at narcotics, we've looked at human trafficking, we've looked at all kinds of things to see if there's any indication as to why somebody would pick this family. 'They went through a significant amount of effort and violence to take one three-week-old baby. 'Why?' The death was ruled a homicide, but details from the autopsy have been withheld because of the ongoing investigation . The family was moved to a different location Wednesday to protect them as police released the new information. The names of the baby's parents and uncle have also not been released for their safety. Cox declined to say if the family had been under police protection since the shootings. He said: 'They know where they live, obviously. 'Somebody may want to silence them further. 'They've tried to kill them once already and they killed their child. 'We can't just sit back and wait. 'We're hoping that they're local and we may get something.' A $25,000 reward is being offered for information that leads to any arrests. Long Beach Police urge anyone who may be able to identify the vehicle or driver who approached the victim on January 3, 2015, to call Long Beach Homicide Detectives Donald Goodman and Mark Mattia at (562) 570-7244.

c6b86ac84728b44be48915600bac2e93d6dbbcd3,"Kim Kardashian does it. Jennifer Lopez does it too. And now Australian women are shelling out up to $3000 to learn how to do it. The Kardashians have turned the art of contouring, a technique that involves highlighting and shadowing the face, from a make up insider secret to something many women - and some men - have tried to master. The demand to learn the secret to a flawless face is so high in Australia that one Hollywood make up artist is in the country this week to teach sold-out workshops in Sydney and Melbourne. Scroll down for video . The Kardashian look: Australian women are embracing the contouring make up technique, which uses highlighting to 'sculpt' facial features . Behind the blush: Kim Kardashian is a huge fan of contouring, and revealed to fans what goes into her high maintenance make up look in this Instagram picture . Lilit Caradanian is a professional make up artist with a roster of celebrity clients and over 840,000 Instagram followers. The 30-year-old was flown here to teach the the techniques used by Kim Kardashian and Jennifer Lopez's 'glam squads' to groups of women who have shelled out up to $3000 each for a three-day master class. Lilit spoke to Daily Mail Australia during her Sydney workshop, which will be followed this week by more sold-out classes in Melbourne. Eager to learn: Australian women are embracing the trend, and some have shelled out up to $3000 for a master class this week to learn from a top Hollywood make up artist . Tricks of the trade: Make up artist Lilit Caradanian (pictured) says that '90 per cent' of her students and clients request contouring . 'Contouring is really popular over here,' she says. 'I always ask what the class wants to learn and right now contouring is 90 per cent of the feedback I get. 'My students who are make up artists tell me their clients come to them asking about contouring. The average consumer knows about contouring, but doesn’t have the knowledge to do it themselves.' While the Kardashians are largely responsible for alerting the masses to the magic of contouring, Lilit credits Jennifer Lopez with pioneering the trend - even if her fans didn't know she was doing it at the time. 'JLo – it started with her. Scott Barnes, her former make up artist, created and then became a master of contouring,' Lilit says. 'And then he became Kim’s make up artist, and she started carrying that look as well.' Makeover: Lilit shares her contouring technique with Daily Mail Australia . Before and after: The contouring technique can give the illusion of a different face shape, sculpted jawline and cheekbones . 1. Start with applying your foundation as normal . 2. Next take a peach-hued concealer, approximately two shades lighter than your skin and apply under the eyes to highlight, blending as you go . 3. Use the same concealer on the straight bridge of the nose, middle of the forehead and centre of the chin (think everywhere the light catches) and blend, blend, blend . 4. Next, take a contouring cream two shades darker than your foundation . Sculpt the face: Concealers, highlighters and contouring creams are used . 5. Swirl some of the contouring cream onto a brush and start by outlining around the hairline. This should look like you are ‘framing’ the face. Blend the contouring ‘in’ (starting from the outside of the face and blending inwards) 6. Finish the ‘frame’ by sweeping the colour under the jawline. 7. Trace the contour cream below the cheekbones, creating a triangle of colour that points to the corner of the lips . 8. Take some more colour and contour on either side of the bridge of the nose and also in the crease of the eyelid . 9. The final step is to blend, blend, blend using a foundation brush to ensure there are no firm lines . Illusion: Contouring can be used to slim a face, hide a double chin, and highlight cheek bones . So, what is contouring exactly? 'It’s not just drawing lines on your face. It’s about bringing out certain features we want and receding features we don’t want to show so much,' Lilit tells DMA. 'If you have a double chin, you can contour it to make you look a little bit slimmer – it’s an illusion. You’re sculpting your features.' 'The ideal shaped face is the oval shape, so if you don’t have that, you can contour your face in certain areas to create the illusion of the oval shape, and to bring out the features.' Lilit's clients have become savvy about contouring. 'A few years ago, when I’d ask my clients what they want to do with their make up, they would say they wanted a smoky eye, some liner, lashes. Now it’s just about contour. They don’t care what you do with their eyes or lips, as long as they have contour. Pioneer: Jennifer Lopez was an early adopter of contouring . 'The bridal industry has taken this turn where the bride wants to feel like a celebrity the day of her wedding - all eyes on them. They want to feel like a Kardashian, they want to feel perfect.' Celebrities have embraced the art of contouring because it helps them photograph flawlessly. But how does it translate to real life? With heavy duty contouring taking up to an hour, Lilit says there are a few short cut methods that can be adapted for everyday. 'A woman shouldn’t spend longer than 15 minutes getting ready in the morning. You don’t need to highlight and contour every day. 'A simpler technique is with a powder bronzer, which you can use in the same way as a contour, it’s easier, on the go, and you don’t need to sit there and blend it for an hour. All you really need is some good base – tinted moisturiser or foundation, some bronzer so you don’t look pale, blush, and you’re good to go. In demand: Professional make up artist Lilit Caradanian has over 840,000 Instagram followers and celebrity clients . There are a few different contouring methods, says Lilit. 'You can use heavier creams, which are great for photo shoots but not if you want your make up to last all day. There are also thinner, more liquid creams, which have more staying power.' And for Australia's humid climate, where woman are regularly victims to their carefully applied make up slipping off in the heat, Lilit recommends a powder base. 'For people with oily skin or if you live in a humid climate, you want to go with powder contouring versus cream contouring,' she advises. 'You’re still going to get the same look, but with a lighter texture and feel on the skin.' Celebrity makeup artist, Lilit Caradanian is currently in Australia running an exclusive series of masterclasses for Wedded Wonderland, the country’s leading online wedding magazine.","LA make up artist Lilit Caradanian is in Australia to teach master class .

837f377d77893ffae589c2d4715b31db38af7ed2,"A paramedic who abandoned patients in an ambulance while he went shopping and had a hair cut has been found guilty of misconduct at a health tribunal. Dominic Colella, who has resigned from the London Ambulance Service, twice 'held his colleagues to ransom' by forcing them to wait until his return before they could be driven to hospital. The Health and Care Professions Council (HCPC) sitting at a hearing in Kennington, south London, today ruled he was guilty of misconduct relating to two incidents in March 2013 and he was struck off the medical register. Dominic Colella, who was not present at the hearing, was found guilty of two counts of misconduct while working with the London Ambulance Service . In the first incident, an 85-year-old man who collapsed in the queue in a Marks and Spencer store from severe blood poisoning was forced to wait for 20 minutes in the back of an ambulance. Colella, who failed to turn up at the hearing, had returned to the store and came back with two full bags of shopping before driving him to hospital on March 9, 2013. The tribunal heard Colella's colleague, who was left to care for the elderly man alone, was questioned by the patient's 'anxious' wife about why her husband had not been taken to hospital. Yvonne Purves said: 'After a little bit of time I wondered where [Colella] had gone. 'The wife was understandably anxious about what had happened to her husband and was wondering why we weren't leaving to go to hospital. 'He then came back with two full bags of shopping and loaded them in to the front of the ambulance and flippantly said 'do you want to go to hospital then?'. 'Obviously, I wanted to go to hospital some time ago. I waited 20 minutes for Colella while alone in the ambulance.' The panel heard how Colella left a patient in an ambulance with a colleague for 20 minutes while he did some shopping in a Marks and Spencer (file picture) Just two weeks later, while responding to another potentially life-threatening 999 call, he delayed a 40-year-old patient with a head injury from being taken to hospital and left him in the care of a more junior practitioner so he could have his hair cut. Colella admitted abandoning his colleagues and patients, but the panel said his failure to turn up to the hearing meant they could not know if he appreciated the seriousness of his actions, meaning there was a 'risk of repetition'. Paramedic Donna Blair, who had arrived at the scene first, said she was handing over care of the patient to Colella's colleague when she noticed a nearby shopper looking 'gobsmacked'. She told the panel: 'I looked to my left and saw Dominic sitting at the hairdresser's chair with a lady putting a cape around his neck.' She told the hearing she had thought he was 'just having a joke' when he earlier asked her whether she fancied a haircut, and added that he could do with a trim himself. The panel heard that he delayed the ambulance leaving for hospital by between five and ten minutes. Chairman of the panel, Gillian Fleming, said members of the public would be 'shocked' to know a paramedic could show such disregard for his patients saying his 'fitness to practise was impaired'. Ms Fleming added that they do not know if Colella, who joined the London Ambulance Service in 1996, has since continued to work as a paramedic. Ms Fleming said today: 'Whilst it appears no harm was caused, the potential impact of the registrant's actions could have had serious consequences for the patients. 'The registrant's actions may indicate an attitudinal problem which he appears to have taken no real steps to address. 'There's no evidence to suggest his behaviour has changed.' Ms Fleming said Colella would be struck off the HCPC register with immediate effect, adding: 'The registrant has shown little in the way of insight or remorse. 'The panel considers that a striking off order is the only appropriate and proportionate order in this case.'","Dominic Colella twice 'held his colleagues to ransom' by making them wait .

The proceeds from Saturday's full house for the Six Nations title decider against France includes money from wheelchair users having to pay £41 for entry when the RFU policy had always been for free access and car parking for those using wheelchair facilities — and their carers, if needed. One RFU mandarin said: ‘It’s quite appalling such a charge should be brought in when the wheelchair-bound have been allowed in free at Twickenham from time immemorial. It’s not as if the RFU need the money and is just another example of their rampant commercialism to squeeze extra cash from everywhere, even the disabled.

The RFU, who have 2,318 wheelchair enclosure spaces and a terrace with lift access for 112, say their executive staff brought in the charges following an audit of disabled access by Level Playing Field with the new pricing package being deemed industry standard. LPF said in their report that charging the same price as for able-bodied spectators in the same seating category promotes equality. A RFU spokesman said: ‘We are committed to investing all additional ticket revenue raised from the new charging policy to the upgrading of disabled facilities within Twickenham and we have had a lot of positive feedback. We do not charge for tickets issued to charities nor for tickets to those injured playing rugby.’ England play France on Saturday still in with a chance of being crowned Six Nations champions . The England cricket team’s apparent over-reliance on data during their hapless World Cup campaign led to huge criticism aimed at head coach Peter Moores. And England team analyst Nathan Leamon, a Cambridge maths graduate and former Eton schoolmaster, badly hurt his foot after kicking out in anger in his hotel room in Wellington after a late-night debate with some media pundits about the importance — or not — of cricket stats. The unnecessary comment that had Leamon steaming was from the obnoxious Paul Allott, Lancashire director and peripheral figure on Sky Sports, who asked the numbers expert: ‘Have you ever played the game?’ England's apparent over-reliance on data at the World Cup led to criticism aimed at Peter Moores . The proposed 2016 Olympics men’s Team GB football side, mischievously relayed to the other home nations by former FA general secretary Alex Horne on his last day in office, has been kiboshed, not only by the FIFA ExCo in Zurich last Thursday, but at the FA board meeting on the same day. The three other countries were strongly opposed and the issue has also raised questions as to why England have had a monopoly on the GB football seat on the British Olympic Association. However there are still plans to send a GB women’s side to Rio. There will be no 2016 Olympics men’s Team GB football side in Rio next summer . Adam Johnson is set to receive a tough reception if, as expected, he returns for Sunderland at West Ham on Saturday following his arrest on suspicion of sexual activity with a 15-year-old. Upton Park chants aimed at the England winger will be brutal. The match is live on Sky and talkSport and both will have sound engineers on their outside broadcast teams to monitor the volume of crowd obscenities. Adam Johnson is set to return to the Sunderland team after his suspension by the club was lifted . Champagne’s puzzle . Former FIFA executive Jerome Champagne’s fanciful bid for the FIFA presidency — which failed to get the necessary backing from five countries — seemed from the start to be at Sepp Blatter’s bidding. And Champagne wouldn’t comment yesterday on speculation he has written Blatter’s mission statement ahead of the election. Blatter said: ‘My manifesto is the work I have done in FIFA.’ UEFA president Michel Platini snubbed the official FIFA ExCo dinner in Zurich on Thursday night — preferring pasta with his entourage to celebrate the Champions League progress of his former club Juventus. Jerome Champagne’s bid for the FIFA presidency failed to get the necessary backing from five countries . Simon Clegg, chief operating officer of the inaugural European Games in Baku this year, has ambitions to become chairman of the British Olympic Association if Lord Coe is elected president of the IAAF. But Clegg needs the Azerbaijani-bankrolled Games to go well first and he’s just lost his second communications chief in quick succession — both leaving suddenly for personal reasons.","Disabled fans must pay for Twickenham tickets for first time this season .

d0d721291605be371e8cb4c106bb1507c640eadc,"After an NFL season to forget, Minnesota Vikings star running back Adrian Peterson celebrated his 30th birthday in style on Saturday with an extravagant Arabic-themed party in his home state of Texas. Peterson is currently at the center of much speculation about who he’ll be playing for next season, but he put all that behind him at the weekend and took his own life into his hands as he entered his birthday bash on the back of camel. The elaborate celebrations included costumes, an ice bar, a cake shaped like a middle eastern palace and a special guest appearance by actor Jamie Foxx who can be seen hamming it up on the dance-floor and in the DJ booth in cellphone footage that's appeared on social media since. Scroll down for video . Minnesota Vikings star running back Adrian Peterson celebrated his 30th birthday in style on Saturday by entering the extravagant Arabic-themed party on the back of a camel . Peterson, posing above with one birthday guest, celebrated turning 30 on Saturday with a no-expense-spared party in his home state of Texas . The big 3-0 typically signals the beginning of the end for an NFL running back, but Peterson didn’t let that spoil his fun on Saturday night. The Vikings' all-time leading rusher appeared in only one game in 2014 because of the child abuse case that involved injuries to his 4-year-old son. He was indicted on September 11, 2014, by a Montgomery County, Texas, grand jury on charges of reckless or negligent injury to a child that occurred on May 18, 2014. He is accused of beating his four-year-old son with a tree branch, which Peterson consistently referred to as a 'switch', causing severe welts and bleeding on the child's back, legs, buttocks, genitals and ankles. In their initial response, the Vikings deactivated Peterson for a single game. Peterson’s 2014 NFL season was over after arbitrator Shyam Das ruled in favor of the NFL on November 18, 2014, saying, 'the league can keep Adrian Peterson on the commissioner’s exempt list,' effectively terminating the Minnesota Vikings running back's season. Actor Jamie Foxx was one of the guests in attendance for Peterson's party and he can be seen hamming in up on the dancefloor and in the DJ booth in cellphone footage that has appeared on social media since . The elaborate celebrations included costumes, an ice bar and a cake shaped like a middle eastern palace . His suspension, ordered by Commissioner Roger Goodell through at least April 15, was tabled after a federal judge knocked down the NFL arbitrator's denial of Peterson's appeal. Peterson was returned to the special exempt list, pending further developments on the legal front. He has three years remaining on his Vikings contract and is owed $12.75 million next season, but relations between the two parties are currently described as tenuous. While team officials have said they want Peterson back, he has questioned their commitment in the wake of the suspension controversy. The Vikings' all-time leading rusher appeared in only one game in 2014 because of the child abuse case that involved injuries to his 4-year-old son . In an interview with ESPN last month, he called the collaboration between the Vikings and the NFL to place him on paid leave the week after he was indicted in Texas 'an ambush.' Peterson's agent, Ben Dogra, said on Friday that he declined an invitation from Vikings general manager Rick Spielman to meet over dinner during the NFL owners meetings in Arizona next week. The Texan has featured in six Pro Bowl selections, run for 10,190 yards and scored 86 touchdowns since joining the NFL. He has only played for the Vikings since his league debut in 2007. In 2012, Peterson rushed for 2,097 yards, finishing nine yards shy of breaking Eric Dickerson's all-time record for running yardage in a single NFL season.

Burnley striker Ings arranged to meet Harlee-Jae Procter, four, and her family, after reading about her story on Twitter. Harlee-Jae suffers from a rare genetic condition and is a huge fan of Ings' team Burnley. Danny Ings poses with four-year-old fan Harlee-Jae Porter as he attempts to help her with her bucket list . Ings and his 'new best friend' pose together while meeting at Burnley's training ground and making plans . The striker, tipped as a future England international, was so moved by her plight that he met her at his club's training ground and promised to help her tick off as many of the items on her wishlist as possible. Ings said he had made 'a new best friend' after meeting with the schoolgirl. The Clarets hotshot has now promised to take Harlee-Jae to the zoo, to Turf Moor as his mascot and even joked he would dress as Elsa from the film Frozen to entertain her. Harlee-Jae became a fan of Ings after playing the video game FIFA. During their meeting, she told him about her hopes to be a cowgirl, ride an elephant and eat breakfast with Barney the Dinosaur. Ings told the M.E.N.: 'It's a nice feeling for me to meet her. Hopefully we can work together and tick off as many things as we can. I think we can do most of them. Ings has been excellent for Burnley recently and his form earned him a kiss on the cheek from his super-fan . Burnley beat Manchester City 1-0 at Turf Moor last weekend and the fight against relegation is still alive . 'We're going to contact the zoo and see if we can go there for the afternoon and we're going to see some animals so I'm really looking forward to that. 'I've never been to a zoo so I'm looking forward to it just as much as she is. I'm really excited for it. 'I've got myself a new best friend. And she gave me a kiss on the cheek as well which was nice.' Thorn Primary School pupil, Harlee-Jae suffers from microdeletion 17 q12, which causes her health problems including kidney disease. She is likely to need liver and kidney transplants before adulthood. Mum Sasha Procter, 25, said Danny's efforts to help Harlee-Jae were overwhelming. She said: 'All she's said all weekend is ""Danny Ings"". We never ever expected him to do anything like this – she just wanted to meet him. 'You don't see many Premier League footballers doing something like this. Hopefully we can tick off some items from the list together.' Since creating her list, Harlee-Jae has flown in an airplane cockpit, travelled in a police car with Bacup officers and is due to visit the Lancashire Police Mounted Section. Ings and Harlee-Jae have already planned a trip to the zoo, which is a first for both of the two friends .","Burnley's Danny Ings met with a fan suffering from a rare genetic disorder .

20193b543d884703efb49bc1b1520594b2069371,"Washington (CNN)It doesn't matter how many times Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu now says he still wants a two-state solution with the Palestinians. The White House is refusing to take him at his word. ""We take him at his word when he said that it wouldn't happen during his prime ministership, and so that's why we've got to evaluate what other options are available to make sure that we don't see a chaotic situation in the region,"" President Barack Obama said in an interview with The Huffington Post published Saturday. These are the President's first public comments since Netanyahu's party captured the most seats in Tuesday's parliamentary election. Netanyahu has said in at least three post-election interviews that he still believes in Palestinian statehood, despite his pre-election flip-flop on the issue in what experts called a desperate appeal for conservative votes. Only on Thursday, two days after the election, did President Obama congratulate Netanyahu by phone on his victory. White House press secretary Josh Earnest declined to say whether Netanyahu clarified his position on the two-state policy during that phone call. But Obama told the Prime Minister that the United States would ""reassess"" aspects of its relationship with Israel after Netanyahu's earlier provocative statements opposing the creation of a Palestinian state. Administration officials have said the United States is now considering signing on to a U.N. resolution which supports a Palestinian state. Regarding comments Netanyahu made Tuesday about Arab Israeli voters going to the polls ""in droves"" -- comments described by some as racist -- Obama told The Huffington Post that that kind of ""rhetoric"" was ""contrary to what is best of Israel's traditions. That although Israel was founded based on the historic Jewish homeland and the need to have a Jewish homeland, Israeli democracy has been premised on everybody in the country being treated equally and fairly."" Obama added: ""If that is lost, then I think that not only does it give ammunition to folks who don't believe in a Jewish state, but it also I think starts to erode the name of democracy in the country."" U.S. House Speaker John Boehner, who invited Netanyahu to address that controversial joint meeting of Congress earlier this month, plans to visit Israel at the end of the month. While the speaker's office says the trip was planned well before the Prime Minister's re-election, it will come around the deadline for an initial nuclear deal between Iran, the United States and other world powers.","President talks with Huffington Post about Israeli leader .

b2e3b0ee9b33b740d523c0098c92d4c0ee1e14fd,"Killer co-pilot Andreas Lubitz was able to hide his psychological problems from airline bosses because of a 'gaping hole' in the system for assessing pilot health, an air safety expert has claimed. Lubitz had torn up a sick note declaring him unfit to fly on the day he crashed a Germanwings plane into a rocky ravine in the Alps, killing himself and everyone on board. The 27-year-old is believed to have consulted medics about severe psychological and visual disorders and been told he was too ill to fly by two doctors before the crash. But due to confidentiality rules, this information was not passed onto Gemanwings operator Lufthansa and he was able to fly the doomed Airbus A320 that day. Scroll down for video . Andreas Lubitz was able to conceal his health issues from Lufthanza because of Germany's privacy laws which mean GPs cannot disclose information about their patients' health and the onus rests of employees . Under patient confidentiality rules, which also operate in the UK, pilots do not have to disclose their profession to GPs and doctors are not able to pass on their concerns to airlines. The onus of reporting any health issues rests solely on the 'honesty' of pilots. Tony Newton, a British pilot who has flown Airbus A320s for 20 years and who also works as a Civil Aviation Authority examiner, said that the system 'has to change'. 'It's a gaping hole in the system. It would happen in the UK as well,' he said. 'As a pilot, my medical life at work and my medical life at home are absolutely separate, unless I choose otherwise. Nobody checks that you communicate your health problems to the airline. 'Pilots have a yearly medical examination, which includes a chat about how we've been feeling psychologically, but it's fairly low-key. 'If I go to the GP, there it no requirement for me to disclose that I'm a pilot. 'And if I see the doctor for something that may affect my ability to perform my duties, he is prevented from communicating that to the airline because of medical confidentiality. 'The onus is on me to hold my hands up and tell the aviation authorities. The system is not well policed. It relies on honesty. A simple headstone has been laid in Seyne-les-Alpes, the closest accessible site to the area of the crash . Flowers have been laid at the headstone, known as a stele, to remember those who died in the crash . 'There is a legal obligation for pilots to tell their employers if they have surgery, or an illness that requires more than 21 days off work, or have been prescribed a long list of certain drugs. 'But the GP doesn't get involved.' Lubitz had visited Dusseldorf University hospital in February and more recently on March 10 and is believed to have been concerned about vision problems. An ex-girlfriend claimed he had always dreamed of flying larger planes but had recently recognised his ambition could not come true because of his mental health problems. The co-pilot had previously been treated by psychiatrists for 'burnout syndrome' which required him to take a break from pilot training in 2009. He was allowed to complete his training in 2013 and get a pilot's licence, under the condition he had regular medical exams. But it appears that because of confidentiality laws governing GPs, Lufthansa would not have been informed about Lubitz's struggles unless he told them himself. French gendarmes have been at the crash site, recovering clues and body parts from the wreckage . Dozens of search workers have been deployed by helicopter because the crash site is so inaccessible . Officials confirmed that Lubitz's remains have already been found, and not a single body had been recovered . Mr Newton added: 'I'd like to see a more robust mechanism. Most pilots don't go around intentionally exploiting it, but the door is open for someone who has serious mental problems to hide it from the aviation examiner. 'It also leaves the door open for mistakes. 'A pilot friend of mine quit smoking with help from a drug prescribed by his GP. 'He mentioned it casually to the airline examiners a few months later, and they told him he shouldn't have been flying under the influence of that drug. 'He had no idea. If there had been a crash, it would have been appalling. 'It's very dangerous and the system needs to be tightened up.' Lufthanza said it was unaware of any psychosomatic or other illness affecting the co-pilot. German newspaper Bild am Sonntag reported investigators had found evidence to suggest Lubitz was concerned he was losing his eyesight, possibly because of a detached retina. The condition causes the thin lining at the back of the eye to detach from blood vessels that supply it with oxygen and nutrients and is often marked by flashes in the eye. Relatives of victims, including Philip Bramley (centre) have gathered at the site of the crash in Le Vernet . Flowers and candles have been laid by mourners at the headquarters of Germanwings in Cologne . It causes blurred vision and without treatment can lead to blindness. The newspaper reported that it is unclear whether his vision problems had physical or psychological causes. Lubitz is believed to have locked pilot Patrick Sonderheimer out of the cockpit when he left to go to the toilet before he put the plane into a descent. Black box recordings revealed that Sonderheimer hammered on the door asking to be allowed in, but Lubitz failed to answer. Minutes later on Tuesday morning the plane crashed into the Alps at a speed of 400mph, killing everyone on board. Among the dead were three Britons - including a seven-month-old baby. Since the tragedy a picture of Lubitz has emerged as a passionate and dedicated flyer who had previously struggled with a bout of depression. He was focused on flying, having joined a glider club when he was just 15. Committed and ambitious, his former girlfriend Maria told German newspaper Bild that Lubitz had hoped to fly larger planes, such as the Boeing 747 jumbo jet. 'She said that he recognised in the last month that his dream cannot come true because of his mental illness,' Bild reporter John Puthenpurackal told the Sunday Times. Lubitz's former girlfriend also said he would get 'angry' about his conditions at work and struggled with the pressure of holding onto his job. She claimed she ended the affair because she realised the pilot had problems. French Red Cross members and residents living nearby have paid tribute to the 150 people killed in the crash . While Maria claims to have been in a relationship with him, he shared his Düsseldorf flat with a woman who was believed to have been his fiancée. Large quantities of prescription medicines for treating mental illness were found at his flat. As well as his passion for flying, he is believed to have been an avid runner - training for the Iron Man endurance rest in Hawaii. Bernard Bartolini, the mayor of Prads-Haute-Bleone, said he met the father of Andreas Lubitz at a memorial on Thursday for relatives of those who died in the crash. 'He was distraught with grief. He was a completely broken man who is carrying all the responsibility of this drama on his back,' Bartolini said on BFM-TV. 'He lost a loved one, but also because his son is perhaps the (cause) of this tragedy.'","Co-pilot Andreas Lubitz tore up a sick note declaring him unfit to fly .

106ba6433d078acddb99ce66c0c0ab6cb0d80fe2,"(The Hollywood Reporter)Sam Simon, the nine-time Emmy Award-winning comedy writer and producer who helped develop ""The Simpsons,"" made millions after leaving the show in 1993 and then donated his riches to charity, has died, his foundation announced on Facebook. He was 59. Simon was diagnosed in February 2013 with terminal colon cancer. Yet through it all, he tried to remain upbeat and keep his sense of humor. ""The Museum of Broadcasting called and said, 'We were thinking about doing an archive interview with you. Do you mind if we did it now?' "" Simon said with a laugh on Marc Maron's WTF podcast that first ran in May 2013. During his brief career, the influential Simon also served as the showrunner on the sitcom ""Taxi"" at the age of 23; wrote for and produced the comedies ""Cheers"" and ""The Drew Carey Show""; and created a Fox series for the legendary stand-up comic George Carlin in the mid-1990s. Simon also wrote the 1991 film ""The Super,"" a 20th Century Fox comedy starring Joe Pesci as a New York slumlord. Most recently, Simon was a consultant on the Charlie Sheen series ""Anger Management"" and hosted a show on Radioio.com. He showed up frequently on Howard Stern's SiriusXM show and in March 2013 thanked the acerbic host for being ""the perfect friend."" Story: Terminally Ill 'Simpsons' Co-Creator Vows to Give Away Fortune . A cartoonist and Stanford graduate, Simon developed ""The Simpsons"" with Matt Groening (who came up with the characters based on his family) and producer James L. Brooks. All three had worked on ""The Tracey Ullman Show,"" where Bart Simpson and his family got their start as animated sketches shown before and after commercials. ""The Simpsons,"" centering on TV's ""first fully self-aware dysfunctional family,"" as Simon put it, debuted on Fox on December 17, 1989, and is now the longest-running primetime series in American history. Ken Levine, an Emmy winner who has written for ""The Simpsons"" and other sitcoms, described Simon's contribution to the show during a 2009 interview published in Stanford Magazine. ""Sam brought a level of honesty to the characters,"" Levine said. ""Is it too bizarre to say he made cartoon characters three-dimensional? His comedy is all about character, not just a string of gags. In 'The Simpsons,' the characters are motivated by their emotions and their foibles. 'What are they thinking?' -- that is Sam's contribution. The stories come from the characters."" Simon also is credited with assembling the show's elite writing team that included Al Jean, George Meyer, John Swartzwelder, Mike Reiss, Jon Vitti and Conan O'Brien. Story: James L. Brooks on 'Simpsons' journey . ""I remember Sam coming into the room, and me pitching to him and initially being really intimidated,"" O'Brien told Vanity Fair in 2007. ""He's hilarious. It was fun to try and make him laugh. I remember that about Sam. If I could make Sam laugh, I was excited."" Tired of the grind, Simon exited the show in 1993 after four seasons but worked out a deal tied to home video sales that he said paid him ""tens of millions"" every year. The agreement also guaranteed him executive producer credit long after he departed, and his name appears in the credits of every episode. A couple of years after he left, Simon knew he would have enough money to retire from show business. He was in his mid-30s. As detailed in The Hollywood Reporter's 2013 Philantrophy Issue, Simon's charitable contributions include founding the Malibu-based Sam Simon Foundation (worth nearly $23 million as of 2011) that rescues the hungry and feeds stray dogs. His other pet charities include PETA, which in February thanked him for his support by naming its Norfolk, Virginia, headquarters The Sam Simon Center; international nonprofit Save the Children; and the Sea Shepherd Conservation Society, a global marine conservation organization. His generosity led the latter in 2012 to name one of the four ships in its fleet of vessels -- used to hinder whaling and illegal fishing -- the M/Y Simon. Simon also turned a Malibu spread into a canine haven that rescues dogs from kill shelters and trains them as companions for the deaf. ""The sort of lifetime achievement stuff that I'm getting now is kind of like Tom Sawyer's funeral because they all know I'm sick,"" Simon told THR's Gary Baum. ""I am getting buildings named after me and awards and stuff. The truth is, I have more money than I'm interested in spending. Everyone in my family is taken care of. And I enjoy this."" In May 2014, it was revealed that Simon spent $60,000 to rescue an abused thoroughbred. Simon, who won eight of his Emmys for writing/producing ""The Simpsons"" (many after he left) and one for producing ""The Tracey Ullman Show,"" was married to and divorced from actress Jennifer Tilly (1984 to 1991) and Playboy Playmate Jami Ferrell (for mere weeks in 2000). Neither marriage produced any children. Born June 6, 1955, Simon grew up in Beverly Hills in an era when the neighborhood was ""quaint,"" as he put it. Groucho Marx lived across the street, and he recalled walking into his parents' room as a youngster and finding the legendary comic and his mom sitting on the bed. (He stressed they weren't about to have sex.) Another time, Elvis Presley returned the dog that Simon had lost. While at Stanford, Simon drew cartoons for the local newspapers in San Francisco and the school paper and landed a job at Filmation Studios doing storyboards for ""The New Adventures of Mickey Mouse"" and ""Heckle & Jeckle."" Simon scored his first TV writing gig on the animated ""Fat Albert and the Cosby Kids"" in 1979. He mailed in a script to ""Taxi"" (co-created by Brooks) that was accepted, and that led to a staff writing position and then the job as showrunner. Simon also went on to direct episodes of the Carlin show, ""The Drew Carey Show,"" ""Friends,"" ""Norm"" and ""Anger Management."" An avid poker player, Simon re-created his home game in a penthouse at the Palms Hotel in Las Vegas for a Playboy TV show in 2009. The show also featured Tilly -- a very good player -- as well as comedians Dave Attell, Norm Macdonald, Jeffrey Ross and Artie Lange. Another one of Simon's more eclectic pursuits was working the corner at amateur fights and serving as president of Sweet Science Inc., which managed boxer Lamon Brewster. His fighter stunningly knocked out Wladimir Klitschko to win a share of the heavyweight championship in 2004. During his chat with Maron, Simon noted that the way to know when to put down your ailing dog is to ""list the three things he loves to do. When he can't do those any longer, it's time. ""One of my three things is laying in bed and watching TV. So by that criteria, I will never be euthanized."" Later, talking about all the millions he's given to charity, he added: ""I kinda like it when people talk about me as a special person. But I know I would be a nut if I didn't have a lot of money.""

ea1356decf14555ca6f18510276766b9c483766a,"Even the more well-travelled among us would struggle to scratch the surface of Unesco's World Heritage List. Jaw-dropping scenery, ancient monuments and incredible wildlife are just a few of the 1007 sites earmarked for preservation by the organisation. But while well-known destinations such as Machu Picchu and the Acropolis in Athens may feature prominently on many intrepid explorers' 'to do' list, there are a number of stunning sites that the majority of us will simply never get to see. Here, we highlight a number of Unesco World Heritage sites that due to conflict, or deterioration, risk being lost to us forever - as well as a few destinations that you may be able to see for yourself... but only if you're quick. Scroll down for video . The UNESCO World Heritage sites you may never get to see: . Afghanistan - Minaret of Jam . The glorious Minaret of Jam has was built in the 12th century by Ghurid Sultan Ghiyas-od-din and marks the ancient city of Firuzkuh . The Minaret - in the Ghor province in Afghanistan - is covered in intricate brickwork and blue tiles arranged in Kufic inscription . It has survived countless wars and pillaging  the but Minaret of Jam - situated in a remote spot in the Ghor province of Afghanistan - is facing its biggest challenge yet. Extensive restoration work is needed to preserve the ancient structure, which is at risk from erosion from a nearby riverbed as well as a compromising tilt, similar to the tower at Pisa. The 65 meter needle was built in 1194 by Ghurid Sultan Ghiyas-od-din, and is covered in intricate geometric brickwork as well as Kufic inscription in dazzling blue tiles - yet most people will never get to see the Minaret. Not only is the monument miles away from the nearest human settlement, it lies in a dangerous Taliban stronghold making travel to the region virtually impossible. North-West Iraq - Samarra Archaeological City . The Great Mosque and spiral minaret are among a collection of remarkable monuments in the city, 80 per cent of which has yet to be excavated . The archaelogical city at Samarra in Northern Iraq marks the site of a powerful Islamic capital city that ruled the region for much of the 9th century. The Great Mosque and soaring spiral minaret are among a collection of remarkable monuments in the city, 80 per cent of which have yet to be excavated. Unfortunately for the rest of the world, this rich cultural landscape is out of bounds. The city is located in the North-West of Iraq which remains in the grip of a bitter and ongoing conflict between local militia, Isis and Kurdish forces. When, and indeed if, the remaining site will be excavated is doubtful. Ancient city of Aleppo - Syria . The city of Aleppo was named the 'Islamic Capital of Culture 2006', although you won't find any tourists there today . The Grand Mosque in the ancient city of Aleppo is at risk due to the ongoing civil war that blights the country . Syria's rich and glorious cultural heritage is demonstrated by the sheer volume of ancient monuments and historic sites that punctuate this embattled landscape. The ancient city of Aleppo contains elaborate mosques, palaces and evidence of a Graeco-Roman street layout, and there are signs of occupation dating back as far at the 10th-century BC. Hinting at its former glory, the city was even named the 'Islamic Capital of Culture 2006', although you won't find any tourists there today.The country is in the grip of a bloody and bitter civil war that shows no signs of abating, and the Foreign Office advises against all travel to the war-torn country. Bethlehem - Birthplace of Jesus: Church of the Nativity and the Pilgrimage Route . The Church of the Nativity is located within the Palestine occupied West Bank, an area that holidaymakers are advised to avoid . The alleged birthplace of Jesus: Positioned in the Palestine occupied West Bank - an area the Foreign Office says is 'currently tense' Six miles south of Jerusalem, on the site Christians have called the birthplace of Jesus since the 2nd century, is the Church of Nativity. The oldest church in daily use in the world, the original basilica  was built in 339 AD, and parts of it survive below ground. A cave, over which the first Church was built, is traditionally believed to be the birthplace of Jesus. While the site sees streams of religious visitors, its positioning in the Palestinian occupied West Bank - an area the Foreign Office says is 'currently tense' means it's not one for the average tourist. And even if you do get to it, the church is in danger of crumbling - with the roof structure being vulnerable to lack of maintenance and repair. And due to an increase in the number of vehicles, as well as unregulated tourism, pollution now affects its outside walls. Its preservation relies on the unlikely partnership of the Israeli government and the Palestinian Authority, so it remains at high risk. Timbuktu - Mali . Timbuktu was founded in the 5th century and came to prominence in the 15th and 16th centuries when it was a centre for learning . Desertification has left many of Timbuktu's buildings vulnerable, while political instability in the region prohibits all but essential travel . Remote, yet endlessly fascinating, Timbuktu  has become synonymous with inaccessibility over the centuries. Once hailed as the intellectual and spiritual capital of Islam in Africa in the 15th and 16th centuries, today the city remains as distant and increasingly isolated. Founded in the 5th century, Timbuktu was previously a thriving economic and cultural hub in spite of its isolation, and the mosques and holy shrines in the city once played an essential role in the spread of Islam throuhgout Africa. Situated in the gateway to the Sahara desert, the ancient mosques and libraries of Timbuktu are under now at the mercy of the elements. Climate change and desertification has left many of the buildings vulnerable, and continued political instability in the region prohibits all but essential travel. Democratic Republic of Congo - Kahuzi-Biega National Park . Kahuzi-Biega National Park (right) is home to one of the last remaining groups of eastern lowland gorillas (left) - but only around 250 remain . The Kahuzi-Biega National Park covers a vast area of tropical rainforest in the Democratic Republic of Congo that is dominated by two dormant volcanos - Kahuzi and Biega. The Park's diverse flora and fauna make it one of the most ecologically rich in the world, let alone Africa, and it's home to one of the last remaining groups of eastern lowland gorillas. However, despite efforts to preserve the population, only 250 gorillas remain in the park at present, and poaching and political instability in the region have left the Park exposed to worrying levels of destruction. The country is virtually off-limits to travellers with the Foreign Office guidance advising against all but essential travel to most regions. And the endangered sites should visit before they disappear: . Belize - Barrier reef . The barrier reef in Belize is the largest in the Northern and Western Hemispheres and is famed for its pristine corals and clear blue water . Coastal development and tourism also put pressure on the stunning, but fragile, ecosystem, so if you do travel there, be responsible . The barrier reef in Belize is the largest in the Northern and Western Hemispheres and is famed for its pristine corals, crystal-clear waters and white sandy beaches. It is also home to the a number of threatened species, including the West Indian manatee, hawksbill turtles and the American crocodile. However, much like the iconic Great Barrier Reef in Australia, the future of the reef in Belize is under constant threat from a number of factors including climate change, coral bleaching and the frequent hurricanes that blight the region. Coastal development and tourism have also put pressure on the stunning, but incredibly fragile, ecosystem, so if you do travel there, be a responsible tourist! Peru - Chimu Kingdom, Chan Chan . In its prime during the 15th century, the vast kingdom was the largest earthen city in pre-Columbian America . The walls of the buildings in the vast city were often decorated with intricate friezes representing abstract motifs . While Machu Picchu may be more well-known, the remains of the Chimu kingdom in Peru are just as fascinating. The walls of the buildings in the vast city were often decorated with intricate friezes representing abstract motifs, although the fragile nature of the earthen structures mean the site is slowing-but-surely eroding, so get there soon if you can. In its prime during the 15th century, the kingdom was the largest earthen city in pre-Colombian America and the remains of temples, dwellings, irrigation systems and funeral platforms can still be seen today. United Kingdom - Liverpool Maritime Mercantile City . Today, the city the thriving city is perhaps best known for The Beatles and the its football teams, but its rich mercantile heritage lives on . A little closer to home, the city of Liverpool has a rich maritime heritage and was once a thriving commercial port. In the 18th and 19th centuries the city played an integral role in the growth the of British Empire - a legacy that remains to this day. During this time, the city pioneered the development of modern dock technology and transport systems, and was a major port for the mass emigration of people to America. Today, the city the thriving city is perhaps best known for The Beatles and the its football teams, but its rich mercantile heritage lives on, despite the threat of urban sprawl and new developments that are unsympathetic to the vernacular of its historic buildings. Colombia - Los Katios National Park . Los Katios National Park is home to countless endangered species - including the Central American Tapir and the Giant Anteater (left) After years spent in the tourism doldrums, visitor numbers are finally on the increase in Colombia as the South American country enjoys a period of relative political calm. If you are planning a trip, consider a diversion to Los Katios National Park, which is home to countless endangered species - including the Central American Tapir - as well as incredible flora and fauna. Situated in the North West of the country, 95 per cent of the park is considered to be in pristine condition, but the threat of pollution, illegal hunting and agricultural sprawl remains an ever-present threat. Indonesia - Tropical rainforests of Sumatra . The parks are home to an estimated 10,000 species of plants, around 200 species of mammal - including the Sumatran tiger . This once vast island of tropical rainforest has shrunk significantly over the past 50 years due to illegal logging, among other things . The tropical rainforests in Sumatra comprises three national parks: Gunung Leuser National Park, Kerinci Seblat National Park and Bukit Barisan Selatan National Park. Collectively, the parks are home to an estimated 10,000 species of plants, around 200 species of mammal - including the Sumatran tiger - and around 580 species of birds, making it an ideal destination for animal lovers. But this once vast island of tropical rainforest has shrunk significantly over the past 50 years. The spread of illegal logging, encroaching agriculture and poaching have devastated some parts of the rainforest and still pose a significant threat.","There are 1007 incredible sites on the UNESCO World Heritage List .

Nine members of the jury found Henry Chau Hoi-lueng, 31, guilty by a 8-1 majority although his co-accused Tse Chun-kei, 38, was acquitted. Both men had previously pleaded guilty to charges of preventing the lawful burial of Chau's father Chau Wing-ki, 65, and his mother, Siu Yuet-yee, 63. Henry Chau Hoi-lueng, pictured, has been found guilty of the brutal murder of his parents in Hong Kong . Chau's parents, Chau Wing-ki, 65, right,  and Siu Yuet-yee, 62, left,  were chopped up and cooked with rice . Tse was handed a one-year jail term for the unlawful burial charges but was released from custody due to the length of time he has already spent on remand. However, Henry Chau will be sentenced on Monday. The South China Morning Post said Judge Michael Stuart-Moore described Henry Chau as an extremely dangerous man who was a complete failure in life. Judge Stuart-Moore added that the killer blamed everyone except himself for his current problems. Both men denied murdering the couple on March 1, 2013. The court heard that Henry Chau's parents went with him on the morning of their murder to see his new home in Tai Kok Tsui. Several days after they disappeared their eldest son Chau Hoi-ying wanted to raise the alarm, but Henry Chau said the couple had travelled to mainland China on a visit. Eventually the eldest son went to the police with the killer to report their parents missing. The court heard that Henry Chau sent a Watsapp message to friends admitting killing his parents. Chau Hoi-Leung will be sentenced on Monday after a jury found him guilty by a majority verdict of 8-1 . Tse Chun-kei (pictured), was cleared of the murder charge but admitted preventing a lawful burial . Police found the heads of Chau's parents inside these refrigerators removed from Tse's apartment . One of the friends reported the message to police who arrested Henry Chau and his friend Tse Chun-kei. Searching Tse's flat, forensics officers recovered the couple's heads stored in two large refrigerators. Several plastic lunch boxes containing chopped flesh and organs were also found. A further three plastic boxes containing salted body parts were found in a different room. The missing body parts are believed to have been cooked and eaten. A pathologist reassembled the skeletons, which had same parts missing. He testified that the couple were stabbed in either their chest or neck before being dismembered. Henry Chau told investigators that he wanted to kill himself six months before the attack, but was convinced to take revenge on his parents instead by Tse. Police believe that the couple were murdered and dismembered in Tse's flat, although he denied taking any part in the killing. Police show the weapons used by Chau to kill his parents after he invited them round for dinner . Prosecutors claimed that Henry Chau and Tse discussed a range of methods of disposing of the bodies - including mixing the remains with cement and throwing them away as bricks. Other plans included cooking the remains and throwing them into the sea. Tse said the only reason he helped Henry Chau is because he was afraid that his friend would kill his mother. Henry Chau first claimed that he did not kill his parents but only helped his friend dismember the remains. He later tried to plead guilty to manslaughter on grounds of diminished responsibility.","A Hong Kong man killed his parents before dismembering their bodies .

a86a30666a824f751aa485bdbf5b07211cc2fa61,"After decades in the doldrums, eggs appear to have a cracking future. Consumption rose by 2.4 per cent in 2014, which equates to an extra 700,000 that are boiled, scrambled and fried every day of the week. It is a remarkable resurgence for the egg, which has suffered from a series of health scares and changes in food fashion since the 1950s when the nation was happy to ‘Go to work on an egg’. The revival is being attributed to the fact they form a central part of protein-rich diets such at Atkins and Paleo, which promise weight loss and even a longer life. Consumption of eggs rose by 2.4 per cent in 2014, the equivalent of 700,000 extra a day. Experts are crediting the revival with the rise of protein-rich diets including Atkins and Paleo . As a result, egg sales are now finally back to the levels seen in the 1980s when the former Tory health minister Edwina Currie infamously labelled them a health threat because of salmonella contamination. That attack fuelled existing concerns about eggs, which were also being demonised by doctors for containing high levels of cholesterol, which was wrongly assumed to fur up the arteries. However, the egg has become healthier following a change in the diet of the hens, with the result the cholesterol level is down by some 13 per cent to some 100g, which is a third of the recommended daily limit. At the same time, Vitamin D, which is vital for healthy bones, is up by 64 per cent compared to a decade ago. The net result is that eggs are now being actively promoted as a health food given they are also full of the protein, vitamins, minerals and essential fatty acids that are vital to a healthy body. Until 2009, Britons were warned against eating more than three eggs a week because of the worries about cholesterol – but this warning has now been junked. Research by experts at University of Surrey found overweight people given two eggs a day as part of a reduced calorie diet lost weight and saw no increase in blood cholesterol levels. If you are looking for a loan, serving your bank manager breakfast might just do the trick. A compound found in eggs makes people much more generous, new research suggests. Scientists say that tryptophan, an amino acid found in some foods, can change our behaviour. In experiments they found that consuming a small portion of tryptophan - the equivalent of that found in three eggs - doubled the sum volunteers gave to charity. Eggs and other foods such as fish and milk are rich in tryptophan, an amino acid that is converted in the body into the feel-good chemical serotonin. And the US Dietary Guidelines Advisory Committee has recently recommended that limitations on consumption of cholesterol found in eggs should be removed from official health guidelines. It stated: ‘Cholesterol is not considered a nutrient of concern for overconsumption.’ A spokesman for the British Egg Information Service said: ‘Health professionals’ recognition of their health benefits, and the end of the confusion over their effect on cholesterol, mean eggs are now being widely recommended as part of a healthy diet. ‘They are also included in all major slimming plans, from established groups such as Weight Watchers and Slimming World, to more recent trends such as the Atkins and Paleo diets.’ Egg consumption has also been boosted by the trend to eat breakfast at dinner under the rise of the ‘Brinner’ – a trend that has been imported from America. In total, 32 million eggs were eaten every day in the UK in 2014, equivalent to 11.7 billion throughout the whole year. ‘Consumption from retail purchases exceeded six billion for the first time in 2014, having grown 16 per cent in the past five years,’ said the spokesman, adding that consumption had returned to levels last seen before the salmonella crisis of the late 1980s. The details were reported by Farmers Weekly, which said sales have also been helped by supermarket promotions and price cuts. Data obtained from retail analyst Kantar Worldpanel shows that, in the 52 weeks to the end of February, the GB retail market for eggs was up 2.4 per cent in volume terms. The egg has become healthier following a change in the diet of the hens, with the result the cholesterol level is down by some 13 per cent to some 100g, which is a third of the recommended daily limit . However, the supermarket price cuts meant the actual value of these sales fell by a significant 4.8 per cent to £768m. Andrew Joret, chairman of the British Egg Industry Council, said he anticipated another year of rising consumption in 2015, pointing to the sector’s first TV advertising in 10 years, as well as a new Main Meals in Minutes recipe campaign fronted by fitness entrepreneur and celebrity Lucy Mecklenburgh. A fan of the Brinner trend, she said: ‘I’ll often eat eggs for dinner when I get home from a work out in the evening. They are quick, nutritious and not to mention tasty.’ The British Lion eggs TV advertising campaign featured commercials by Oscar winning Tom Hooper, director of The King’s Speech. It was launched alongside the eggrecipes.co.uk website, which offers advice on everything from how to boil an egg to get a soft runny centre to more exotic soufflé frittatas, flamenco eggs and desserts.","Consumption rose by 2.4% in 2014, the equivalent of an extra 700,000 a day .

Miss Vinson, 30, a nurse at Texas Presbyterian Hospital in Dallas, was diagnosed with Ebola days after visiting Coming Attractions Bridal & Formal store in Akron, Ohio in October. The store temporarily closed and was cleaned before reopening, but its owner, Anna Younker, said there was a lingering 'stigma' and business failed to bounce back. On Friday she announced on the shop's Facebook page that the bank has now cut off the business credit line, forcing her to sell the building for $338,000. Negative press: Coming Attractions Bridal & Formal store in Akron, Ohio, (above) which was linked to Ebola nurse Amber Vinson, is now up for sale after business failed to bounce back . Chain of events: Miss Vinson, 30, a nurse at Texas Presbyterian Hospital in Dallas (pictured), was diagnosed with Ebola days after visiting the shop in October . The store, located at 1220 E. Tallmadge Ave., is listed with Cutler Real Estate. Particulars describe it as a 'great 4,000 sq ft brick retail building, built in 1996 with eye-catching curb appeal. 'The space would be ideal for beauty shop, message facility, auto parts store, doctors/dentist office, day-care center or veterinarian with plenty of parking.' Younker, who has been in business for 30 years, said her shop became known as the 'Ebola store' after news of Vinson's visit hit the press. She claims that the temporary closure and canceled orders cost the store at least $100,000. The loss wasn't covered by her insurance because the plan excludes viral illnesses. Ms Younker told NewsNet5 that Miss Vinson, who was visiting her hometown for a few days to plan for her wedding, should have been more careful. Sanitisation process: The store temporarily closed and was cleaned before reopening, but its owner, Anna Younker, said there was a lingering 'stigma' and business failed to bounce back . 'I wish that now she knew better not to travel. The impact its had on me is huge,' the store owner said. 'Never in a million years did I expect something like this to cause our business to have to close.' Ms Younker said she was particularly offended when Miss Vinson asked for a $480 refund on her bridesmaid dresses. Miss Vinson, who recovered from Ebola nine days after treatment, asked that the shop refund her bridesmaids the $479.89 they paid for their dresses, via her attorney. Ms Younker said the refund request feel like 'a slap in the face'. In January she posted a message to customers on Facebook, announcing that her business would be closing down. 'Despite our best efforts, we simply have been unable to recover,' she wrote. 'The decision for me to close was not easy for me. Anna Younker (above), who has been in business for 30 years, said her shop became known as the 'Ebola store' after news of Vinson's visit hit . 'Over the years I have met and worked with the most amazing brides, mothers of brides, bridesmaids, prom girls and many other wonderful people. 'I want to thank all our customers, the people in our community and the well wishers from afar for being so supportive. Your kind words and loyalty have been great comfort. 'I also want to thank my amazing staff for all of their hard work and dedication to our customers and our business. I appreciate your understanding and support.' One of the four staff members losing their jobs, Kayla Litz, told NewsNet5 that the Ebola scare had been particularly worrying for her because she was in her first trimester of pregnancy at the time. Ms Litz came through the quarantine period of 21 days Ebola-free along with the other employees of the store. The store is still filling orders that were made through January and plans to shut for good in May. Akron officials had considered ideas to help relocate or save the store, but its operators said they didn't plan to take the city up on that offer.","Coming Attractions Bridal & Formal store in Akron, Ohio announced its closure in January after it never recovered from its link with Ebola .

Education Secretary Arne Duncan, a former professional basketball player and a Chicago pal of the president, also attended. Although most of Obama's group wore orange 'Tiger Pride' T-shirts to support the Princeton team, the president kept it traditional with a dark brown sweater. Both first lady Michelle Obama, who is currently traveling in Cambodia, and her brother Craig are Princeton alums. It wasn't just family favoritism that got Obama cheering from the stands in College Park, Maryland. The president had selected Princeton to make it to the final four on his March Madness bracket. And although his niece didn't play in the game, there was still plenty of excitement to witness as the undefeated eighth-seeded Princeton team overcame a tight first half to win 80-70. It was the first time the women's team had won an NCAA game in Princeton's history. Obama (pictured with daughter Malia and nephew Avery Robinson) stood out in a sea of 'Tiger Pride' T-shirts in his brown sweater . Obama and Craig Robinson react to Wisconsin-Bay scoring against Princeton. Princeton won the game 80-70 and remained undefeated . Even the president couldn't distract Courtney Banghart, the team's coach, from the important tournament game. Banghart said she frequently saw Obama during the game because he was sitting right in front of her family. 'I'd be like, ""Oh my God. It's Barack"". But it certainly wasn't my focus,' she said. But Banghart said having the president in the stands will certainly 'go down as a highlight.' Even the opposing team's coach had to get it on the Obama action. 'The president came. I'm going to let my guard down for a minute and be excited about that,' said Green Bay coach Kevin Borseth. 'I shook his hand. And I got a picture.' A brief chant of 'Four more years!' rose from some spectators during the game's second half, drawing a chuckle from Obama. Security was increased due to the president's presence, with metal detectors and bomb-sniffing dogs present at the stadium's entrance.

1e2923c18cbe24bc11fedcfa42db66f8ba8a2989,"Disgraced PC Darren Heath, 44, pictured with a woman who has nothing to do with the case, admitted using his position to take advantage of women . A predatory PC admitted abusing his position to have sex with three vulnerable women he met on duty. Darren Heath, who worked as a family liaison officer for Gloucestershire Police, took advantage of his victims over an 11-year period. The 'manipulative and calculating' 44-year-old also harassed a fourth women and repeatedly went to the home she shared with her partner. Heath, who also worked in restorative justice, admitted five counts of misconduct in public office between July 2002 and February 2013 at Bristol Crown Court. He also denied two counts of rape, one of theft and two further charges of misconduct in the public office - accessing the police database and failing to report an alleged rape. The remaining charges will lie on the court file after his not guilty pleas were accepted by the prosecution. Gloucestershire Constabulary's Professional Standards Department began investigating Heath following a single complaint in 2012. But concerned officers decided to look back through their database and identified a number of other potential victims. Senior Investigating Officer with the Anti-Corruption Unit, Detective Inspector Giulia Marogna, said: 'It then quickly became clear there were a number of ladies he may have offended against. 'Darren Heath would use his position as a police officer, whether it was during his time working in restorative justice or as a family liaison officer, to identify women he could offend against. 'These were often victims of crime who were already extremely vulnerable but who he wanted to take advantage of even further. 'Our investigation has been lengthy because we have had to spend time regaining the confidence of women who had been badly let down by someone they should have been able to trust, precisely at a time when they needed him the most. 'Heath was manipulative and calculating while he was offending and that is one of the reasons he was able to carry on doing this over a number of years. Detective Inspector Marogna said the case will now be referred back to the Professional Standards Department to consider the action the force will next take. Heath, 44, will return to Bristol Crown Court, pictured, for sentence next week after admitting charges of misconduct in a public office . She said the most disappointing thing was that Heath showed no remorse and made no comment throughout his interviews. 'Those victims have shown incredible bravery by supporting this prosecution and I want to pay tribute to them for that,' the detective inspector added. 'It doesn't stop here though - I have absolutely no doubt there are more victims out there and I would appeal to them directly to come forward.' She added that it was 'very satisfying' that justice had finally caught up with Heath. Heath, who appeared in court in blue jeans, green jacket and blue v-neck sweater, visibly shook as he stood in the dock for the brief hearing. The defendant, of Taynton, Gloucestershire, was released on bail to return to the court for sentence next week.","PC Darren Heath had sex with three vulnerable women he met on duty .

283014942e1e6cd2e6e71d7bdccb42619b6d9aa5,"The Yak is back and so is the question that used to annoy him but now just brings a smile. Age, for the striker who scored more Premier League goals than Cristiano Ronaldo and Fernando Torres, has always been more than a number. That is possibly because David Moyes once joked Yakubu Aiyegbeni was a ‘Nigerian 25’. And because Steve McClaren claimed the striker told him he was 25 when he signed for Middlesbrough 10 years ago. Reading striker Yakubu insists he has never been concerned with the questions marks over his age . So, how old is he? The profiles say 32; the sceptics are ruder. The big man among Reading’s big dreamers says he’s heard it all before. ‘It was always like this,’ he says. ‘But it does not bother me. Kanu has had it as well. 'I just laugh about it — people joke and that is it. If I was lying I don’t think I would be playing now. I would be retired.’ Thankfully for Reading and the FA Cup, the jibes have not got the better of him. Yakubu scored the goal that saw off Derby in the fifth round to set up the tie against Bradford, guaranteeing at least one side from outside the Premier League will be at Wembley in the semi-finals. For the neutrals, the hope is that League One Bradford can trip up another bigger club. For Yakubu, there is the hope that he can make it to Wembley for the first time after a mangled achilles tendon kept him out of Everton’s 2009 final defeat against Chelsea. The Nigerian striker scores Reading's second goal during the FA Cup fifth round defeat against Derby . Saturday (kick-off 12.45pm). TV: BT Sport 1 (from 12pm). If he does, it will complete a quite surreal journey that spans almost three years since he left Blackburn — ending 10 seasons in England — following relegation to the Championship. His absence has seen him scream at confused Chinese footballers and gain a sweaty taste of football in Qatar. ‘No regrets,’ as Yakubu says. And yet there were times in China, at Guangzhou R&F in the days before Sven Goran Eriksson rocked up, where he quite literally had no idea what was going on. ‘When I was there (after leaving Blackburn), we had a Brazilian coach (Sergio Farias) and he spoke in Portuguese,’ Yakubu says. ‘A guy that speaks English, he had to translate into English and then another guy had to translate from Portuguese to Chinese. The manager is supposed to speak for like five minutes but we are there for nine minutes. Yakubu, seen here celebrating a goal against Manchester City in 2004, scored 43 goals for Portsmouth . Yakubu made sure Reading reached the FA Cup quarter-finals with this goal against the Rams . Yakubu felt he was away from English football for too long and jumped at the chance to return . ‘It’s so difficult to speak with your team-mates. You don’t know how to tell him to pass. You just scream at him and when you scream, he knows that he has to give you the ball. ‘When you want to go shopping or to a restaurant, you have to have it written in your phone in Chinese and you have to show it. Everywhere you go, you have to take your phone and show it to the taxi driver. ‘But when Sven came in, it was great to work with him again. I worked with him at Leicester City. He is always really calm. He just wants you to enjoy the game. Yakubu has scored more Premier League goals than Cristiano Ronaldo (above) and Fernando Torres . The frontman also scored 35 goals in 103 games for Middlesbrough between 2005 and 2007 . ‘Sometimes when I played two or three games and didn’t score, he never said to me, “You didn’t score”. He’d just walk towards me and say, smiling: “It’s been a while since you scored”. Always calm.’ After 18 months in China, Yakubu wound up at Al Rayyan in Qatar last year. He is confident that despite having to train in the middle of the night, they can host a good World Cup. ‘I had a good offer in Qatar,’ he says. ‘It was another experience so no regrets. Believe me, they can get a good World Cup there. They have nice stadiums. But when it is hot, it is hot. We had to train at 9.30pm in summer. You finish training at about 12 and then go home at 12.30am and then bed at about 4am. You have to stay home all day because it is really, really hot. You can’t train when it’s 50 degrees, it is too much.’ The 32-year-old had offers from American, China and Qatar ahead of his move to Reading . He adds: ‘In winter it is good, we can train at 4pm. We played matches at 7.30pm or 8pm and they have to stop for water breaks once or twice.’ On deadline day last month he came back to the country where he first arrived in 2003, when Harry Redknapp took a punt on a striker playing in Israel. ‘Even when you play the big teams, Harry makes you believe,’ he says. ‘He’ll say, “The defence is not good. Come on, just kill him”. If you’re scared, like you’re going to play against Sol Campbell, he’d say, “Sol Campbell? He’s s***. Don’t worry”.’ The memories of his first English stint make him happy. Now his hope is to finally reach Wembley on his second chapter. ‘Every player wants that,’ he says. You’re never too old to dream.

edb76783b709bf26afc2e8e60df384ec4ed8e09f,"(CNN)President Barack Obama shared jokes about pot and Hillary Clinton's email controversy at the annual Gridiron Club dinner in Washington on Saturday. The club's dinner brings together Washington's media elite, with noteworthy politicians typically attending, as well. Despite being held by a media organization that raises scholarship funds for journalism students, the dinners are generally closed to cameras. Organizers only allowed a select few pool reporters to enter while the President spoke. The lack of media glare allows guests to let some of their guard down, perhaps unleashing a few more jokes than they might if the cameras were rolling. At one point Obama, clad in a white tie, predicted he would get more laughs this year than in the past. ""I'm not saying I'm any funnier. I'm saying weed is now legal in D.C.,"" he said. Voters in the District of Columbia legalized small amounts of marijuana last year, much to the chagrin of some in Congress. The President also touched on the controversy over the archiving of Clinton's emails while she was secretary of state. Obama lamented that while he was once a tech-savvy candidate, Clinton now seemed more up to speed. ""Now I'm yesterday's news, and Hillary has got a server in her house. I didn't even know you could have one of those in your house. I am so far behind. Did you know that? I would have gotten one,"" he joked. The domain name for Clinton's private email address was @clintonemail.com. Obama wasn't the only politician attending this year's dinner. Wisconsin Gov. Scott Walker also dropped in. He's of course rumored to be in contention to run for president in 2016. Walker, a Republican, acknowledged some headlines of his own, like when Rudy Giuliani said at a Walker event last month that he doesn't think Obama loves America. To date, Walker hadn't said whether he agreed with Giuliani or not. ""I want to get this out of the way once and for all. I believe President Obama loves America and every single American in it.  Except for Rudy Giuliani,"" Walker said, according to a transcript provided by his staff. ""If I did not love America, I wouldn't have moved here from Kenya,"" Obama later countered in a joking reference to unsubstantiated theories that he wasn't born in the United States. Every president since 1885 except for Grover Cleveland has attended the 130-year-old organization's dinner. Obama has attended three times as president and last attended back in 2013.","""If I did not love America, I wouldn't have moved here from Kenya,"" Obama quips .

b65cda306b3da34b6ffd5ab87c61c3fca9d550d0,"Des Moines, Iowa (CNN)For Iowa's economy, corn is everything. So it's no surprise that the Republican governor and other powerful voices in state agribusiness are vocal backers of the Renewable Fuel Standard, a federal rule that requires gasoline to be comprised of up to 10% in renewable fuels. One of those is ethanol -- with corn often a key ingredient. ""Don't mess with the RFS,"" Gov. Terry Branstad said Saturday, offering a not so subtle warning as he kicked off a daylong agriculture summit that featured a string of likely Republican presidential candidates. The RFS is a major issue that White House hopefuls are forced to address whenever they visit the No. 1 corn-producing state that also goes first in the presidential nominating calendar. But it's a less popular policy for small government conservatives, who decry the mandate as federal overreach in the private sector. In his first 2016 visit to Iowa, Jeb Bush sought to delicately explain his desire to see the RFS disappear over time. ""The market's ultimately going to have to decide this,"" he told the audience at the event, which took place at the Iowa State Fairgrounds. Bush acknowledged that the mandate, which passed in 2007, has helped lower dependence on foreign oil and boost corn-heavy economies. ""But as we move forward over the long haul, there should be certainty for people to invest,"" he argued, saying ethanol will no longer need help from the government. ""So at some point we'll see a reduction of the RFS need, because ethanol will be such a valuable part of the energy feedstock for our country."" He declined, however, to suggest when exactly that may happen. In his remarks, Bush also defended his position in favor of legal status for undocumented immigrants after they meet a wide set of requirements. And while attending a fundraiser Friday night in Des Moines, he stood by his support for Common Core, the controversial testing standards that have become a point of contention for conservatives. Election 2016: Jeb Bush makes his first Iowa foray . Bush's frank statements on the RFS and his defense of some of his most controversial views indicated that the former Florida governor plans on sticking with his positions as he gets ready to hit the campaign trail, no matter how unpopular they may be to certain audiences. Still, he was not totally immune to at least some pandering. Bush told the crowd that he'll be cooking some ""Iowa beef"" Sunday when he's back home with his family in Florida, adding that he'll probably make some ""really good guacamole,"" too. Talking about campaigning for his father's presidential campaigns in Iowa, Bush said he went to at least 50 counties. ""I remember eating really well -- eating really, really well."" With a John Deere tractor towering near the stage, each candidate sat on stage for a 20-minute Q&A with Bruce Rastetter, an agribusiness entrepreneur and major Republican donor in Iowa. The audience of close to 1,200 was comprised largely of farmers and other leaders in the agriculture industry. While Bush took a mild approach to the RFS, Sen. Ted Cruz of Texas flat out opposed it, saying Washington shouldn't be ""picking winners and losers."" ""I have every bit of faith that businesses can continue to compete and continue to do well without having to go on bended knee asking for subsidies, asking for special favors,"" he said. ""I think that's how we got in this problem to begin win."" Ethanol proponents argue that because oil companies own gas stations, consumers are unable to access ethanol and therefore it needs the government's support to break through oil's stronghold of the market. Cruz acknowledged that his view wouldn't be well-received, but tried to argue that it proved his authenticity. ""Look, I recognize that this is a gathering of a lot of folks who the answer you'd like me to give is, 'I'm for the RFS, darn it.' That'd be the easy thing to do. But I'll tell ya, people are pretty fed up, I think, with politicians that run around and tell one group one thing, tell another group another thing."" Former Texas Gov. Rick Perry took a similar stance and defended his decision to request a waiver that would exempt Texas from the federal mandate. If individual states want to require that ethanol be used in gasoline, that's fine, he said, but not the federal government. ""I philosophically don't agree that Washington, D.C. needs to be making these decision that affect ... our agriculture industry,"" Perry said. Other contenders offered entirely opposite positions. New Jersey Gov. Chris Christie, for example, said he ""absolutely"" supports the RFS. ""That's what the law requires. So let's make sure we comply with the law. That should be the minimum,"" he said, drawing applause from the crowd. Rick Santorum, who won the Iowa caucuses in 2012, ticked off what he called a ""laundry list"" of benefits, including more energy independence and more jobs for farmers. ""It is very important for rural Americans,"" said the former senator from Pennsylvania. For his part, Mike Huckabee argued that the ethanol mandate was a matter of national security. ""America needs to do three things to be free: feed itself, fuel itself, fight for itself,"" the former Arkansas governor said, adding that relying on foreign governments for energy leads to a weakened United States. Huckabee, who won the Iowa caucuses in 2008, hit back at criticism that politicians like him simply support the RFS for political reasons. ""The decisions are made not just frankly for what's best for Iowa -- that's not the rationale. You can't make a decision and say, 'It's good for Iowa. Gee, they're the caucus state, we better suck up to them.' We better make decisions that are good for every consumer,"" he said. Wisconsin Gov. Scott Walker, who's had a strong showing in polls since he visited the state in January, made clear that while he's generally a free market guy, he believes ethanol is being blocked from consumers and needs government assistance. ""Right now, we don't have a free and open marketplace, and so that's why I'm willing to take that position,"" he said. But, similar to Bush, Walker said that he expects ethanol can one day compete openly and ""you no longer need in the industry to have these subsidies."" The audience at Saturday's event was largely subdued, given the tone and dialogue of the summit was more substance, less red meat. Those who supported the RFS, however, received a strong response from the crowd. As for those who opposed it, Bill Couser, who co-chairs a campaign called America's Renewable Future which pushes the ethanol mandate, said he's not ready to write anyone off quite yet. But those candidates can expect to hear a lot more from him in the coming months. ""Maybe I didn't like a few of their answers, but it's going to give me some time to go help them understand the issues,"" he said.","Iowa politicians, residents very protective of corn's role in their economy .

Trainee Detective Constable Amy Beautridge said: 'This was a most unusual crime and distressing crime, during which the two young victims were terrified by threats made by the suspect, who intimated he was in possession of a knife. 'He used their fear to control them and force them to effectively do as he said.' She added: 'Despite their young age, the victims have been incredibly brave in coming forward and providing information to the police and I would praise them for this.' 'I am very keen to identify and speak to the person in the CCTV image we have released today, and I would urge anyone who recognises him to call the police or Crimestoppers as soon as possible.

The former Ajax captain who signed for £6million in the summer will miss the remaining ten games, having only made two appearances for the entire season. The Newcastle boss assured the De Jong that he wouldn't be rushed back from such a serious injury. Siem de Jong will miss the rest of the campaign and return for pre-season after suffering a collapsed lung . He said: 'Siem will be back in pre-season. It is one of those we just need to test the water with and see how he is. I've said from the start there's definitely no pressure on him.' Brought in by the cub to add some class and technical ability, the Dutchman managed only one start before suffering a serious thigh injury. De Jong's capture was seen as somewhat of a coup by the club and very much whetted the appetite of the Newcastle fans. But a series of injuries and bad luck have seen the supporters disappointed, with many labeling the club vice-captain a flop. The Dutchman (left) suffered a major setback after being set to return from a serious thigh injury . John Carver (right) is disappointed he won't be able to use De Jong but says the club will be patient with him .

He added: 'The bits we saw from him in pre-season - he scored a couple of goals and his link-up play - were good. Unfortunately we're not going to get that.' Following news of Papiss Cisse's seven-game ban after spitting at Manchester United's Jonny Evans, the Newcastle boss will no doubt have loved to have De Jong fit and playing, with Ayoze Perez, Emmanuel Riviere and Adam Armstrong his only recognised strikers.

Another gruesome, but also strangely touching image, shows the dissected uterus of a New Forest pony preserved in perspex at the Royal Veterinary College, with the fetus still inside the placenta. Dr Adam Rutherford, the geneticist and broadcaster who was a member of the judging panel, said: 'The breath-taking riches of the imagery that science generates are so important in telling stories about research and helping us to understand often abstract concepts. 'It's not just about imaging the very small either, it's about understanding life, death, sex and disease: the cornerstones of drama and art. 'Once again, the Wellcome Image Awards celebrate all of this and more with this year’s incredible range of winning images.'

In total there are 20 images that have been selected as winners in the awards by a panel of nine judges. The overall winner of the competition is due to be announced at a ceremony in London next week. The images are to go on show in exhibitions around the world including Bristol, Glasgow, Dundee, Cornwall, Galveston, Texas, Belfast and Boston, Massachusetts. In one picture - which looks more like a Jackson Pollock painting - the colour coded map of a fruit fly's nervous system is revealed.

The image on the left shows a map of a mouse kidney as it breaks down food to make energy while the tiny bumps on the image on the right are the papillae - tiny bumps - that make a cats tongue feel rough seen using a light microscope in a slide made by Victorian scientists . The yellow neuron is able to sense vibrations while messages entering and leaving neurons at synapses are shown as blue and red circles. The orange circles are mitochondria. Another of the images shows the curved spine of a 79-year-old woman suffering from kyphosis, or dowagers back, taken by Mark Bartley at Addenbrookes Hospital in Cambridge.

The close up view of the greenfly eye shows in detail the thousands of tiny lenses facing in different on its surface that enable the insect to see very fast movements. The insects are unable to see fine details or distant objects however. A scanning electron microscope also helped researchers capture the image of the head of a boll weevil found on the front porch of a suburban house in the USA.

A van driver who tried to smuggle £8million worth of liquid amphetamine in wine bottles has been jailed for five years. Lee Dyer, 40, from St Helens, Merseyside was stopped by Border Force officers at the Channel Tunnel terminal in Coquelles, France last May and told them he had been in Belgium doing plastering and collecting solar panels. Officers found boxes containing more than 100 wine bottles in the back of Dyer's van, the National Crime Agency (NCA) said. The substance inside the bottles appeared oily and later checks showed the liquid tested positive for amphetamine. Dyer was arrested and checks on the van showed it had been hired in Warrington, with Dyer supplying the hire company with a false address. For previous trips he had also used hired vehicles, taking them abroad illegally. Forensic tests on the 99 kilos of concentrated liquid amphetamine in the wine bottles found that there was enough to have produced almost three quarters of a tonne at street-level purity, with a potential street value of almost £8million. Last month, Dyer admitted importing controlling drugs and he was today sentenced at Canterbury Crown Court. Forensic tests on the 99 kilos of concentrated liquid amphetamine in the wine bottles found that there was enough to have produced almost three quarters of a tonne, with a potential street value of almost £8million . Matthew Rivers, from the NCA's Border Policing Command, said: 'The story Dyer told to explain his trips to the continent was a lie. Our investigation proved that in reality he was a professional courier who travelled to the Netherlands to source drugs. 'This was a huge quantity of amphetamine, enough to make many hundreds of thousands of street-level doses and fuel further criminal activity.' Paul Morgan, director of Border Force South East and Europe, said: 'This seizure means a significant quantity of drugs failed to reach the streets and demonstrates Border Force's commitment to keeping them out of the UK. 'We work closely with law enforcement colleagues, including the NCA, to prevent drug trafficking and do all we can to put those responsible behind bars.'","Lee Dyer, 40, from St Helens, stopped by Border Force officials in France .

f9dee2193fe54b2943169bffd9e5c0a2f9f1215b,"(CNN)You may have heard that Israeli politics is extremely complex. But one of the most important forces at play there is actually rather straightforward: When Israelis feel safe and strong they tend to support moderate parties. When they feel vulnerable they move to the right. Understand that, and you will understand Israel -- and why President Barack Obama may have inadvertently given Benjamin Netanyahu a helping hand. Israelis know they need American support to survive in a hostile, increasingly unstable and radicalized neighborhood, but they don't believe they can trust Obama to help keep them safe. And the president, despite taking numerous measures to support the Jewish state, has done a dismal job of persuading Israelis that he has their back. This reality helps explain how Netanyahu and his rightist Likud party pulled off an upset victory this week, despite opinion polls showing them trailing the main opposition Zionist Union heading into Tuesday's election. Clearly, it's not all Obama's fault. Netanyahu's opponents also failed to address security issues, believing a focus on pocketbook matters would be enough. And Netanyahu is a skilled, articulate and shrewd politician. But Obama, like it or not, was one of the reasons for Likud's success. When Netanyahu traveled to Washington a couple of weeks ago to warn the U.S. Congress about an impending ""bad deal"" with Iran over its nuclear program, Obama refused to meet with him, claiming he didn't want to influence Israel's elections. Few believed this was the real reason -- it's no secret the two men don't particularly like one another. Through much of his presidency, Obama has failed to convince Israelis thay they can trust him. And his handling of the recent spat with Netanyahu only added to the problem. By appearing to dismiss Netanyahu's warning of a ""nuclear nightmare"" over the Iran talks by arguing that the prime minister was offering no ""viable alternatives,"" Obama missed an opportunity to reassure security conscious Israelis that the United States will safeguard their survival. His tacit acknowledgment that there might be no alternative to an imperfect deal was of little comfort to Israelis who have spent years hearing genocidal threats from the Iranian regime. Opinion: Will Netanyahu win seal Iran deal? The fact that Obama has become one of the key reasons why Netanyahu continues to win elections in Israel is ironic considering Israelis are profoundly worried about the deteriorating ties with the United States, a relationship they consider key to ensuring their country's survival. One recent poll showed only 37% of Israelis believe Obama has a ""positive"" position towards Israel, a mood that has undoubtedly helped Netanyahu enormously, despite the fact that large numbers of former security officials have said Netanyahu is endangering the country by undermining ties with Washington, and despite Israelis saying close relations with the United States are the second most important factor for Israel's security, behind only Israel's own military strength. All this left a genuine opening for Obama to influence the Israeli electorate, because Israelis desperately want to trust the American president -- and they remain America's biggest, most loyal fans, according to a recent Pew poll. 5 questions about Netanyahu's apparent victory . Yet despite the positive sentiment in principle, Israeli voters -- especially on the right -- have been skeptical that Obama has their best interests at heart. This point was underscored in a recent poll that asked Israelis recently if they believed President Obama would agree to a deal that Israeli officials considered harmful to Israel's security. Of those that responded, 61% said yes, he would do so. However, 95% of Labor supporters said no, Obama would do no such thing, while 93% of Likud voters said they believed Obama would disregard Israel's security. The worry over security extends beyond a nuclear deal with Iran to include the other key foreign policy issue -- the possibility of a Palestinian state. A majority of Israelis still support the creation of two states, one for Israelis and another for Palestinians. And despite the last-minute statements from Netanyahu dismissing the idea, it is important to remember that polls have consistently shown Israelis continue to support the establishment of a Palestinian state, as long as Israel's security can be assured. The trouble is that right now, many Israelis don't believe they can preserve their security with a Palestinian state just a few miles from their major cities, not least because previous territorial withdrawals -- from Gaza and from southern Lebanon -- have simply created launch pads for attacks against Israel. So when rightist leaders such as Netanyahu say Israelis will not be safe with a Palestinian state, voters are inclined to believe them. All this suggests that if Obama wants to persuade the Israeli public to push its government towards compromise, he needs to rebuild the public's trust in him. Israelis want peace, but they also need to be reassured that their safety and survival is a paramount concern of their U.S. ally. And if President Obama cannot assure them of this? Well, they will simply wait until there is a president they feel they can trust. It's not that complicated.","Benjamin Netanyahu secured re-election in Israeli election on Tuesday .

0d66a8e7aadbab448ce8f1707544889f0a89ddb7,"(CNN)You think March Madness is all about basketball? Think again. Sure, millions will be watching the 2015 NCAA Men's Basketball Tournament to see whether Kentucky's bid for an unbeaten season can be quashed or whether a 14 seed can make it to the Final Four. But the popularity of the tournament also spawns another kind of madness -- one that includes college applications, vasectomies and HDTV upgrades. What are the odds? (Probably a heck of a lot better than picking a perfect bracket.) Here are some of the more unusual aspects of the Big Dance: . Glass slipper, golden payoff . Cinderella teams don't just provide a couple weeks' entertainment; according to some studies, their success has long-term effects. Thanks to exposure from the NCAAs, such teams as Florida Gulf Coast and George Mason see rises in applications and endowments. Academics call it the ""Flutie Effect"" after the charge Boston College received from a last-second 1984 win against Miami, thanks to a Hail Mary pass from quarterback Doug Flutie. (Go ahead and watch it again, we'll wait.) Experts debate how much of an influence athletic wins have on admissions, but there's no question a Cinderella turn gives schools greater exposure, which certainly can't hurt. George Mason, which went to the Final Four in 2006, and Gonzaga, which broke into nationwide consciousness in the late '90s, saw applications go up after their turn on stage. Money in the basket . March Madness pulls in more national TV revenue (as of 2013) than any other postseason sports franchise: $1.15 billion. A lot of that money comes from fast-food franchises, which know you like to eat while watching the games. And those franchises may benefit more from losses than wins. According to WalletHub, there's a 19% increase in pizza orders and a 9% rise in dessert orders by fans after their teams lose. Investors certainly know it: Buffalo Wild Wings stock has traditionally gone up in March. Making the cut . Doctors report up to a 50% rise in the number of vasectomies during the NCAA tournament. Well, if you have to spend a few days resting on the couch ... Everybody into the pool . According to a survey by the outplacement firm Challenger, Gray & Christmas, 50 million Americans participate in March Madness pools. Productivity, shmoductivity, part 1 . All that bracket-filling costs employers an estimated $1.2 billion in unproductive workers (assuming each worker spends an hour filling out a bracket). That may be low. WalletHub puts the figure at $1.9 billion. For all that, employers say the tournament is a net positive on morale. Productivity, shmoductivity, part 2 . Twenty-seven percent of respondents to one 2014 survey say they watch games at work. (That could explain the morale situation.) Would you like an upgrade with that? According to the same 2014 survey, 12% would upgrade to HDTV if their favorite team made it to the Sweet Sixteen. (As of 2014, 59% of U.S. households have HDTV.) Bet on the humans . Of the 76 champions, almost one-third -- 25 -- have had mascots based on a human figure, such as Hoosiers and Tar Heels. Fourteen have been bear-related (largely thanks to UCLA's Bruins, who have won 11 championships) and 10 have been feline (Kentucky's Wildcats, mainly). Perhaps you should play the lottery . Odds of picking a perfect bracket are 9.2 quintillion to 1, assuming each team has a 50% chance of winning every game. Odds of winning Powerball: about 175 million to 1. Good luck!

Swiss researchers revealed that chameleons use futuristic nanotechnology more advanced than anything humans possess to carry out their extraordinary colour changes. The reptiles are capable of rearranging crystals inside specialised skin cells to switch hues in order to attract a potential mate or scare off a rival. Scroll down for video . Swiss researchers have revealed that chameleons appear to be capable of rearranging crystals inside specialised skin cells to switch hues in order to attract a potential mate or scare off a rival. A stock image of a colourful panther chameleon is shown . The process involves the active tuning of a lattice of microscopic crystals in skin cells called iridophores. Not only do the crystals allow the lizard to shift rapidly from efficient camouflage to spectacular mating displays,  they also protect it from overheating. It was previously thought that coloured pigments were gathered and dispersed inside different cells, allowing the animal to change hues. Like some other reptiles, chameleons display a wide range of colours produced not by pigments but ‘optical interference’ between different wavelengths of reflected light from tiny crystals, the researchers claim. The crystals are arranged in layers within the iridophores. In studies of the panther chameleon, which comes from Madagascar, scientists found that the creature actively controls the way its iridophore crystals generate colour. The reptiles appear to be capable of rearranging crystals inside specialised skin cells to switch hues in order to attract a potential mate or scare off a rival.

Not only do the crystals allow the lizard to shift rapidly from efficient camouflage and spectacular mating displays, but they also protect it from overheating. It was previously thought that coloured pigments were gathered and dispersed inside different cells. It can turn from a camouflaged green to a bright yellow to attract a potential mate, for example. Physicist Jeremie Teyssier, from the University of Geneva in Switzerland, said: ‘We discovered that the animal changes its colours via the active tuning of a lattice of nanocrystals. ‘When the chameleon is calm, the latter are organised into a dense network and reflect the blue wavelengths. ‘In contrast, when excited, it loosens its lattice of nanocrystals, which allows the reflection of other colours, such as yellows or reds."" The scientists also uncovered a second deeper layer of iridophores containing larger and less ordered crystals which reflect infrared light, which they reported in the study, published in the journal Nature Communications. By reflecting back the sun's heat energy, the cells prevent the chameleon getting too hot in the tropical sun. The scientists made their discovery by watching video footage of chameleons changing colour from blue to green then into yellow and orange – a pattern that couldn’t be explained by pigments in the animal’s skin. The process involves the active tuning of a lattice of microscopic crystals in skin cells called iridophores. In studies of the panther chameleon (stock image), which comes from Madagascar, scientists found that the creature actively controls the way its iridophore crystals generate colour . They modelled what changes might be produced by shifting the spacing of the crystals and found they could simulate and explain the colour changes. Further bolstering the idea that crystals in skin cells are responsible for the animal’s transformation, they compared a sample of ‘relaxed’ chameleon skin with another when the animal was excited and observed a change in the crystal pattern. Professor Michel Milinkovitch, of the university, told the BBC: ‘Chameleons invented something completely new in evolution. ‘They split the iridophores into two layers, one that is specialised for colour change... and one to reduce the amount of energy absorbed by the animal. ‘That's an amazing toolkit that allows them to choose between being hidden or displaying very spectacular colours for communication - and on top of that they have this ability to control their temperature because of the deep iridophores.’","University of Geneva researchers studied panther chameleons .

World-famous lighting architect, Jonathan Speirs, was persuaded to part with a total of £476,864 by friend and neighbour Keith Cameron through a complicated ruse. Now Jonathan's widow Elizabeth Speirs, 58, has revealed the heartless crime has left the family struggling for cash. She has been forced to sell off her home in Edinburgh which she shared with her husband for 24 years. Heartless: Neighbour Keith Cameron convinced his terminally ill friend Jonathan Speirs to part with nearly £500,000 in a complicated ruse . Cameron, 54, conned Jonathan - who was dying of stomach cancer - out of thousands of pounds by claiming his company, Chase Telecom Ltd, required money to win a valuable contract to supply telecom services. The devious businessman repeatedly claimed the company was trading well and that investors had pumped millions of pounds of money into the business. Cameron, who was a close family friend of the Speirs, insisted Jonathan could expect to receive a return on his investment of around £2 million within two years. But it later emerged the entire operation was a lie and that Cameron, also from Edinburgh, had been using Jonathan's cash to maintain a luxury lifestyle. The father-of-two, who has now been declared bankrupt, was found guilty of fraud at Edinburgh Sheriff Court on Wednesday and will be sentenced next month. Jonathan's wife Elizabeth said the cruel scheme had left her and her two daughters, Lucie and Erin, in 'dire straits financially.' Tragic: Elizabeth Speirs is being forced to sell the home she shared with her late husband Jonathan (right) after cruel scheme left them broke . Elizabeth, who recently underwent radiation therapy for early stage breast cancer, said: . 'It hasn't quite sunk in - I'm just very grateful that the jury saw through him. 'He's just a despicable man, and what he did to my husband - who was a good man - is just awful, and the financial situation he has left us in is awful. 'I'm going to have to sell my house soon, as I can't afford to stay. 'I never got a chance to grieve for my husband because I found this out right away. I feel like I have been robbed of so much in my life - my husband, a friend, and the chance to build a new life for me and my daughters. 'My husband had withdrawn money from a policy that he had taken out in case either he or his [business] partner became ill, so that he could exit his company without any financial impact. 'The Camerons have been friends with us for a very long time. They were people we trusted.' On Wednesday, the court heard Cameron had a mortgage of £1.34m million, had bought cars for his wife and daughter, took holidays in a luxury villa and sent his two daughters to an Edinburgh private school. One of his daughters also attended the American Academy of Drama and the Arts in New York and had a student flat near the Empire State Building. Victim: The late Jonathan Speirs was duped into paying £500,000 to Cameron, who spent the money on funding a luxury lifestyle . Cameron had signed off three payments to Jonathan amounting to £75,935, in what were supposedly dividends from the telecoms company but it later turned out to be . Jonathan's own money funnelled back to him. Elizabeth said: 'He [Cameron] did it because he was broke. 'Our money paid for two Minis - one for his wife and one for his daughter. It paid for the school fees for his daughters, and holidays to Portugal and Spain. 'He has been living a lie for many, many years. He hasn't worked since 2009 - since then he has purportedly been setting up a business. He just got used to the good life and he didn't want to give it up. 'But his wife and his daughters are not implicated in this - I want to make that clear. 'It's not something you would have been looking out for. When somebody comes back to you with good states of account and it's a friend who you know has a good track record, you think everything is going to be okay.

Italian researchers have discovered a way to convert the liquid state of extra virgin olive oil into a gel, without the need for other solids. The so-called Gel Oil comes in different flavours (shown above) Known as Gel Oil, the food scientists said it can be added to salads and sandwiches, used in cooking and can be flavoured. Variations include lemon and basil. Olive oil (pictured) has long been linked with lower levels of cholesterol, blood pressure and a multitude of other health benefits . The discovery was made by 10 chemical engineers from the Italian University of Calabria in the southern town of Arcavacata. They used a technique called 'organogelazione' which involves subjecting the properties of certain molecules known in the food industry, such as emulsifiers, to a range of temperatures. When these molecules are heated and mixed they were found to form new structures. The university's food engineering department headed by Professor Bruno de Cindio said: 'In this network structure, the oil remains 'trapped' within the changing texture and transforms itself, in the first stage, into a gel form and, in a second stage, into a creamy spreadable paste.' He added that said that this also means it can be produced in various consistencies from a slightly stickier version ideal for dressing salads and other foods to a more solid variation that can be spread like margarine or butter on bread. The innovation has been patented and the team said it sees huge potential particularly among people with dietary restrictions or moral objections to dairy products such as vegans. The team are now hoping to create a company to sell Gel Oil and already developing variations flavoured with lemon and basil. Valeria Greco, one of the researchers of the team, said: 'Our idea certainly meets the needs of a new customer profile. 'People are increasingly being forced to have fast food meals and that means ready to eat products, but at the same time there is reluctance to compromise on quality and taste and our product very much caters to this market.' Scientists have found olive oil could cut your heart attack risk in just six weeks. The study published in November by the University of Glasgow, found that regular consumption of olive oil dramatically improved chemical signals in the body linked to coronary artery disease. It added just 20mls a day – about four teaspoons - to the diet of healthy adults, which is the amount used in a salad dressing or mopped up by bread during a meal. But a range of signals for heart disease measured in the urine improved in only six weeks, according to the report published in The American Journal of Clinical Nutrition. Scientists have found olive oil could cut your heart attack risk in just six weeks. The study, by the University of Glasgow, found that found regular consumption of olive oil (pictured) dramatically improved chemical signals in the body linked to coronary artery disease . Researchers at the Universities of Glasgow and Lisbon and private firm Mosaiques Diagnostics in Germany investigated the effect of olive oil on heart health in a group of 69 men and women who did not normally eat it. The volunteers were split into two groups and asked to consume 20mls of olive oil either low or high in phenolics every day over a six-week period. Phenolics are natural compounds found in plants, including olives, thought to be responsible for the protective effect of olive oil. The research team applied a new diagnostic technology by examining urine samples for a range of peptides (produced by the breakdown of proteins) already identified as biomarkers of diseases such as coronary artery disease (CAD). Known as proteomics, the technology can pick up altered levels of certain proteins which suggest early signs of disease before symptoms appear. The results showed both groups saw a big improvement in scores for CAD – the most common form of heart disease. Dr Emilie Combet of the School of Medicine at Glasgow University, said ‘What we found was that regardless of the phenolic content of the oil, there was a positive effect on CAD scores. ‘Any olive oil, low or high in phenolics, seems to be beneficial. ‘Our study was a supplementation study. If people in the UK replaced part of their fat intake with olive oil, it could have an ever greater effect on reducing the risk of heart disease.’","Engineers at the University of Calabria, Italy, created the bright gel .

However, a Slovakian firm has said it has finally cracked the problem - and it will sell in it just two years. The AeroMobil can fly 430 miles on a tank of petrol - and when its wings fold down, it'll fit into a normal parking space. Scroll down for video . Aeromobil is a 'flying car' that can fit in a standard parking space, and could both take off and land at any airport in the world. When in flight mode, it can go 430 miles, reaching 124mph - but can fold up its wings to travel on the road and fit in a single parking space. Aeromobil is a 'flying car' that perfectly makes use of existing infrastructure created for automobiles and planes, and opens doors to real door-to-door travel,' the firm says. When in its car configuration, it can fit into a standard parking space, and it also takes normal fuel pumped at every service station. The latest version is the third generation of the craft. 'It is now finalised and has been in regular flight-testing program in real flight conditions since October 2014,' the firm said. At South By Southwest, Juraj Vaculik, co-founder and CEO of AeroMobil, spoke at a panel about the future of flying cars, predicting a world ahead in which these vehicles easily merge with existing transportation. He says it will be on sale in 2017, and that the firm was also developing a self driving (and flying) version. Tatiana Veber, an AeroMobil spokesman said: 'We have been developing the concept of a flying car since 1990. 'Our first model looked quite bizarre and it would have problems in the regular use. 'That was a signal to improve the concept of the flying car in a way to become an integral part of the regular road traffic. The winds fold behind the driver of the car when it is on the road . The car seats two, although the pilot will need a licence to fly it. 'We got a positive feedback from several experts in avionics, which appreciated design and the technical solution of the process of transformation. 'The car is constructed to be fuelled at regular gas stations using the fuel for Rotax 912 ULS engine.' AeroMobil says its third prototype is ready to be shown to the world this October 29th at the Pioneers Festival in Austria. When in plane mode, the craft is powered by a propeller . The firm has even completed the interior of the craft, and says it is undergoing advanced flight tests in Slovakia. However, design is still not perfect- the wings fold into the back seat behind the driver when in car mode.

f2ab7f9023f8ca1a7232d2da1936b8a073863f73,"The appliance of science behind Ronny Deila’s Celtic reign was there for all to see on Sunday afternoon. Any lingering scepticism about his methods surely went the same way as Aberdeen’s resistance. Despite playing with 10 men for much of a demanding, frustrating 90 minutes against Inter Milan three days previously – and the associated, sleep-disturbing travelling – Deila’s team simply ran all over their perceived title rivals in the second half of a 4-0 victory. It was an impressive display of physical power and mental focus. The Norwegian’s insistence that Celtic could be fitter caused a fair degree of controversy early in his tenure. It was interpreted – or perhaps misinterpreted – as a slight on predecessor Neil Lennon. Ronny Deila's Celtic side are starting to become formidable under the Norwegian's reign at Parkhead . But this much is clear. Deila has unquestionably made the Parkhead side more formidable in that regard. And he has all the stats to back it up. Including one which earned recent arrival Gary Mackay-Steven a rapid (in more ways than one) gold star. Crunching the numbers after matches is an important aspect of Deila’s work when it comes to assessing various aspects of his players’ performances. To the 39-year-old, these reams of figures produced by the technology at Celtic’s disposal provide an objective view to place alongside his managerial opinion. The hope is that it leads to better decisions. Again, there would have been a few from the football old-school previously willing to raise an eyebrow at such talk. But what happened at the weekend provided a riposte to any sneers. Deila (centre) is keen on his players being the fittest and results have shown impressive statistics . ‘I think the most important thing is that the players see and also the people around them - you and everybody - see that what we are doing is effective,’ said Deila. ‘There are always things that we can do better and we have had some bad results, but I think we have had six victories after coming home from European games. That’s really good. You don’t see that around the other European leagues. Inter Milan lost at the weekend and they are struggling a lot when they come back — so we did well to win in that way. ‘The amount of metres and sprints on Sunday was unbelievable when you consider we played three days before. We have increased the high-intensity running by 30-40 percent since the summer. That is a lot. Gary Mackay-Steven (right) ran an impressive 1300 metres against Aberdeen on Sunday . ‘We want to be direct, we want to create things, we want to have penetration, we want to be a high-pressing team, so you have to run quick and you see that in the stats and in how we perform.’ Asked if he knew which of his players topped the various statistic tables, Deila broke into a grin. ‘I know everything about the players,’ he laughed. ‘When we played Inter at home, their striker, Rodrigo Palacio, ran 1250 metres at high intensity against us, sprinting. That is an incredible number. But at the weekend Gary Mackay-Steven ran 1300m! ‘You have to know the references of what it means to be fit. It’s easy to say that to the other players, if I tell them how far Gary Mackay-Steven ran in a game and compare it to them. Deila highlighted how impressive Palacio's running was against his side in the Europa League clash . ‘If a player asks me why he is sitting on the bench and not playing, I can show him the numbers. If he is running 600m and the guy in the team is running 1200m, what does he think of that? ‘Why can’t Gary run as far every game? Stuart Armstrong ran 900m on Sunday and he didn’t play the whole game.’ It was pointed out that Armstrong actually lasted only 62 minutes after replacing Kris Commons against Aberdeen, before being hurt and making way for Anthony Stokes. Was that not evidence of the midfielder being overworked? The winger also scored a terrific solo goal against their title rivals to send the Bhoys six points clear . ‘It was cramp, he’ll be okay for (tonight’s game) against St Johnstone,’ said the Celtic manager. ‘It was a sign that he is not strong enough yet. You have to think of the mental and physical loading on a player. ‘Just coming to Celtic - dealing with the contract, the media and so on - used a lot of mental energy in Gary and Stuart. ‘Then the training is at a much higher tempo then they have been used to before. The total loading gets too much. That’s why Stuart started on the bench. ‘But then Scott Brown is doing it every day. He is so strong, unbelievably strong. Why? Because he has done this for many years, he works really hard every single day and he looks after himself. Stefan Johansen is also starting to get that into his body.’ So is it a case of simply saying the best teams are the fittest teams? Scott Brown has been praised by his manager for his unbelievable strength and work ethic . ‘No, that’s not true,’ countered Deila. ‘But that’s the easiest thing to do something with. I don’t think the best teams are the fittest – they could be – but there are so many parameters, so many boxes you have to fill in football. ‘We don’t train more than they did before but hopefully we train better and we give more in that hour-and-a-half every day. ‘As for the stats, we use them in different situations. It is not only stats about running but who has been involved in goal chances offensively and defensively. Instead of saying something subjectively, you can see it as a fact. Stuart Armstrong is also a willing runner for Celtic and his stats are impressive since he joined the club . ‘But everything has to be related to football. We are not marathon runners. It is about what we do on the pitch.’ What Celtic have done on Scottish pitches is win their last 10 domestic matches. Making it 11 against St Johnstone at Parkhead will push them nine points clear of Aberdeen. Complacency might be the creeping danger, but Deila doesn’t detect any traces of that corrosive commodity. ‘There is still so much to fight for,’ he insisted. ‘We are working here on the culture, every day, to be 100 per cent every day. ‘I have no reason to be worried because I haven’t once seen the players have a bad attitude or a lack of concentration. I am really looking forward to the game and I expect a good performance and hopefully a good result.’","Ronny Delia's side are formidable in the Scottish Premier League .

211072f73fad608bbc58055a9ccbb4f3d4be6bb3,"(CNN)I was finishing my studies when the war began four years ago. I had only two subjects remaining before I graduated from university with a degree in English literature. Since I was 10 years old, I have loved English and dreamed of becoming a teacher. I want to teach the younger ones, especially now, because children are the ones who will rebuild our country. They are Syria's future, and they deserve our significant investment. Three years ago, my family was forced to flee our home near Damascus, in east Ghouta. Thankfully, we got out before chemical warfare was used there. We stayed in Syria for the next year, moving from one house to another, from one village to another. With each move, we felt no comfort, no safety. When you feel unsafe in a place that is being bombed nearly every day, you eventually must make a choice: Ours was to leave. And with only two packed bags, we did. We went to Jordan. I've thought of returning to Syria. I want to be part of my country's rebuilding, but sadly, I don't expect this to happen any time soon. When we arrived in Jordan, I thought I would return soon to Syria -- in only a few weeks. We all thought so. It's been two years. And while I still hope to go home one day, my biggest question is: ""When?"" I want to return so that I can teach. As a child, I was inspired by my third-grade teacher, who believed children are the future and who challenged us at that young age to create a better world. I think it's rare for a teacher to instill this so passionately in her students, but I want to try. Although I hope to follow in my teacher's footsteps, my path for now is blocked by the uncertainty of living far from home, by a war that has driven me here, by tuition costs in Jordan that are prohibitively expensive. Being away from home presents many challenges. You feel like a stranger in a foreign place. You're not among people who know you, or who want to know you.  As a Syrian refugee, it is nearly impossible to get permission to be officially employed, and I've no money to complete my studies. Overnight, my dreams changed. In one moment I was at home with family and friends dreaming of studying English, of becoming a schoolteacher.  In the next, it all feels lost. It's impossible to work, impossible to study. We hope to meet our needs today, not so much to fulfill our dreams tomorrow. In Syria, I was responsible to my parents, now I am responsible for them. I dreamed of being a teacher, but because my parents are old, I must try each week just to protect them, to cover their basic needs of shelter, food and medicine. I needed some way to support my family. While most Syrians are not permitted to work, we can volunteer. I found a role with the poverty-fighting organization CARE in the urban refugee center in East Amman, Jordan, where I earn a stipend doing meaningful volunteer work. I have enjoyed it so much. After working there, I have become more social, and no longer feel isolated. It's not like sitting at home, feeling powerless, losing confidence, wondering what I can do to help my family, to help my people. Instead, I feel empowered. I recognize my potential. And, because of that, I refuse to give up on my dreams. My hope is to resettle for the short term in another country so I can continue my studies. I want to complete my education -- and reclaim my dream of teaching Syrian children. Resettling could help shape my future so that I can help shape theirs. One day, I will tell them of the crisis we faced in the Syria that I left. We must be aware of this history, and learn from it. We must empower children to speak up and then be sure that their voices are heard. Change starts with them. And it starts with us. Each person has the right to pursue an education, to meet their most basic needs, to express themselves. When those rights are stifled, so, too, is a person's potential, her opportunities, her power to create a better world, and in my case, a better Syria. My question to the U.S. people and the international community is this: Imagine your life has been turned upside down after you lose everything in a matter of hours: What do you believe in then? What do you cling to? The answer, I think, is: your dreams. We all have them. Mine, for the time being, have been deferred.","Four years of war means four years without schools and education in Syria .

eb95bbf65ce134fd4ce5ff8317d34d76f03255f9,"Los Angeles (CNN)Former rap mogul Marion ""Suge"" Knight collapsed in court Friday shortly after a judge set his bail at $25 million in a murder case, an amount  Knight's attorney said was excessively high. The attorney earlier indicated such a bail was probably higher than his client could post. Knight bent over in his chair at the defense table, with his attorney beside him, and two deputies rushed to him as he was facedown. Moments earlier, the judge ruled that Knight ""has a great potential to flee and apparently has so in the past."" ""In this court's opinion, $25 million is reasonable, and it is so set,"" said Los Angeles Superior Court Judge Ronald S. Coen. Attorney Matthew Fletcher told CNN affiliate KABC that Knight hit his head on a chair and knocked himself out. Fletcher later saw Knight in the holding cell, and ""he was dripping sweat ... like somebody threw a bucket of water on him,"" Fletcher told the station. ""And he wiped the sweat off his head and said, 'I haven't had my medication,' and I said since when, and he said since yesterday. That's when I went back in and told the judge 'You need to make an order that he gets his medicine and he hasn't been fed' and the judge said, 'Well, they offered him food at some point today,' and I said well that's not what I've heard,"" Fletcher told the affiliate. Knight, who suffers from diabetes and blood clots, was taken to the hospital, the attorney said. Knight's condition was not immediately available. He has collapsed before while in custody. Knight has been held in solitary confinement, Fletcher added. When asked about the $25 million bail, Fletcher said, ""It's just laughable."" The bail in other prominent murder cases ""at most is $5 million,"" Fletcher told the affiliate. ""The heads of the Mafia, $5 million (bail),"" Fletcher said. Prosecutors sought the $25 million bail, he added. A preliminary hearing was scheduled for April 13. Knight, 49, has pleaded not guilty to several charges that accuse him of running over two men -- killing one of them -- in January after an argument. Knight is charged with one count of murder, one count of attempted murder and two counts of hit-and-run, with an allegation that he committed a serious and violent felony while out on bail, prosecutors said. The man who died was Terry Carter, 55, a former rap record label owner. The second man is Cle ""Bone"" Sloan, 51. The deadly incident happened on January 29, after a flare-up on the set of the biopic ""Straight Outta Compton,"" a film about the highly influential and controversial rap group N.W.A. The argument spilled over to the parking lot of Tam's Burgers in Compton. The incident is the latest run-in with the law for Knight, who founded the wildly successful Death Row Records in 1991 and signed artists such as Snoop Dogg and Tupac Shakur. Knight was driving the car in which Shakur was a passenger when the rapper was shot to death in Las Vegas in 1996. Shortly afterward, Knight spent several years in prison for violating parole on assault and weapons convictions. That prison time -- along with Shakur's death, feuds between Knight and a number of rappers, and desertions by Dr. Dre, Snoop and others -- contributed to the label's bankruptcy in 2006. In August, Knight and two other people were shot while inside a celebrity-filled Sunset Strip party hosted by singer Chris Brown on the eve of the MTV Video Music Awards. At the time of his most recent arrest, Knight was free on bail in a robbery case. CNN's Rosalina Nieves, Paul Vercammen, Carma Hassan and Greg Botelho contributed to this report.","""It's just laughable,"" Knight's attorney says about high bail .

Claire Brissenden remembers helping her father Ivan refurbish the family home in Heaton, Newcastle in the late 1980s but she had no idea he had used the renovation to hide a time capsule in her bedroom. So the 43-year-old was amazed when she picked up a Facebook message from the new owners of the house, informing her of the  find. Scroll down for video . Claire Brissenden (centre) visits her childhood home in Heaton, Newcastle with daughter Zoe Brissenden-Lang, seven (pictured) after current owners, Beth Barnes (left) and Chris Pearson (right) discovered a time capsule . This week Ms Brissenden took her family back to the house she had not set foot in for quarter of a century to see for the first time the contents of the 1987 package, including a letter written by her late father Ivan when she was just 15. 'It's weird,' she said as she arrived with husband Anton Lang and excited children Zoe, seven, and five-year-old Dexter. 'I feel quite emotional,' said Claire, who was the youngest child and very close to her father, who died five years ago at the age of 85. 'But I'm disappointed there's not more personal stuff in there like a photo. The time capsule was put together in 1987 and includes a handwritten letter from Ms Brissenden's father and a copy of the Mail on Sunday . Ivan Brissenden (pictured), Claire's late father, had hidden the time capsule while he was revamping the Newcastle home they shared in the 1980s - but she had no idea that he'd hidden a time capsule in her bedroom . The package had been wrapped in plastic on which was written 'Documents from the year 1987. Please open'. Inside, among tin foil wrapping, was a copy of the Mail on Sunday- then just 40p- the Independent and You Magazine alongside Ms Brissenden's father's letter noting historic details from the time. In it he wrote: 'My name is Ivan Brissenden. I have been converting this room for my daughter Claire, aged 15. This note was written in June 1987 . The current homeowners, Beth Barnes (left) and Chris Pearson (right) tracked down Ms Brissenden on Facebook after coming across her name in her father's letter . The young couple had found the time capsule after rolling back the carpet in one of the bedrooms as they set about renovating their first home, and saw the words: 'Stop! time capsule behind here' When the homeowners looked behind the board they found the time capsule wrapped in plastic upon which had been written 'Documents from the year 1987. Please open' 'You will see that we have just witnessed the incredible General Election, in which Margaret Thatcher, Britain's first woman Prime Minister was re-elected for a third term- the first tine this has happened for 150 years. 'I have no idea how long it will be before this note is found. But I thought you, the finder, might be interested in the enclosed. I hope it will show you a bit of what life was like in the closing years of the twentieth century.' The time capsule was discovered by Chris Pearson, 24, and 23-year-old Beth Barnes, a civil engineer, after rolling back the carpet in one of the bedrooms as they set about renovating their first home. Claire's father Ivan Brissenden had hidden the time capsule during the renovation of his youngest daughter's room in 1987 (pictured) Claire and her father Ivan Brissenden, pictured on a caravan holiday together in the 1980s- about the time the time capsule was buried . Ms Brissenden, aged just 15, revealing some of the fashions of the 80s when she was living in the family home where it was hidden . First they saw the words: 'Stop! Time capsule behind here' then a package wrapped in tape and plastic which they opened. 'Anyone would have been intrigued!' said Newcastle University PhD student Chris. After coming across Ms Brissenden's name in her father's letter, Chris was able to track her down on Facebook and sent her a message. But it was three years later when the mother-of-three finally checked her inbox and got in touch with the couple. Maggie's cabinet shake-up: Welcome back Cecil . After four years on the back bench following his resignation over revelations that his former secretary, Sara Keays, was pregnant with his child, the former Secretary of State for Trade and Industry Cecil Parkinson was appointed Secretary of State for Energy in 1987. Two held in terrorist scare at Trooping the Colour . In 1987, Glenn Edwards, 27, and another person were arrested at the Trooping the Colour ceremony- an annual event at Horse Guards Parade to celebrate the Queen's birthday- armed with a CS gas canister and a cosh. Undercover police officers spotted him among the thousands lining the route. Edwards denied planning an attack. Pierrette Le Pen: My 25 years of misery . The Playboy bunny, and mother of the leader of the French National Front Marine Le Pen, described her marriage to founder of the party Jean-Marie. Onto the year 2000 . The Mail on Sunday Opinion piece, which followed Margaret Thatcher being voted into her third term in office, suggested that the Tories were in such a dominant position that there would be no challenge from Labour until 2000. No match for men . Writer John Lloyd suggests that women will never be as good at playing tennis as men. Ms Brissenden, who was brought up by her dad, a creative director of an advertising company,  said the idea of his making up a time capsule did not surprise her. 'At the time Blue Peter was doing a lot of stuff about time capsules!' she said. But what did surprise her was the fact this one was not presented in quite the way she would expect from someone so creative. 'It's a manky plastic bag - I wanted a time capsule!' she said. Chris and Beth now plan to rebury the time capsule in another location in the house. The contents of the capsule: It included the handwritten letter from Ivan Brissenden and a copy of the Mail on Sunday dated June 14, 1987 with You Magazine and a copy of The Independent .

The 28-year-old told Good Morning America, 'There are so many ridiculous arguments that MMA is somehow anti-woman. Fighting's not a man's thing, it's a human thing. To say it's anti-woman, is I think, an anti-feminist statement. In the UFC, I mean, I'm the biggest draw in the sport and I'm a woman!'

Somehow, when I do it for money, I'm a barbarian?' Rousey also commented on how MMA has helped to improve the way women are treated in popular culture. In terms of UFC directly working towards that end, Rousey explained, 'Just this last weekend, women were introduced walking to the Octagon not as women's bantamweights, they were just bantamweights.

More pictures have emerged of Islamic State terrorists destroying sites of cultural significance, the latest showing Sufi shrines in Libya being levelled . Mindless: Isis fanatics used a digger to level the shrine in Libya . The fanatics have caused outrage by destroying several ancient relics and sites in Iraq recently, as well as books and rare manuscripts . Isis posted pictures of the destruction in Libya on Twitter, explaining that the vandalism was carried out by its 'police' News of the destruction was tweeted by Conflict News, which posted the images with the message ‘#ISIS in Tripoli province posts photos of its ""police"" demolishing Sufi shrines’. The fanatics have caused outrage by destroying several ancient relics and sites in Iraq recently, as well as books and rare manuscripts. On Monday Iraq’s government began investigating reports that the ancient archaeological site of Khorsabad in northern Iraq had been attacked by the so-called Islamic State. Adel Shirshab, the country's tourism and antiquities minister, said there are concerns the militants had removed artefacts and blown up the site, located nine miles north-east of Mosul. The site before it was reduced to rubble by the extremists . The terrorists began by opening up a huge hole in the shrine . The image appears to show the 'police' en route to the shrine . Saeed Mamuzini, a Kurdish official from Mosul, said militants had already begun demolishing the Khorsabad site on Sunday, citing multiple witnesses. On Friday, the group razed 3,000-year-old Nimrud and on Saturday, they bulldozed 2,000-year old Hatra - both Unesco world heritage sites. UN secretary general Ban Ki Moon has called the destruction a 'war crime'. A statement by his spokesman on Sunday night said Mr Ban was 'outraged by the continuing destruction of cultural heritage in Iraq' by ISIS. Khorsabad was constructed as a new capital of Assyria by King Sargon II shortly after he came to power in 721BC and abandoned after his death in 705BC. ISIS extremists targeted a museum in Mosul using power drills and sledge hammers to destroy artefacts . It features a city wall with a stone foundation and seven gates. Since it was a single-era capital, few objects linked to Sargon II himself were found. However, the site is renowned for shedding light on Assyrian art and architecture. The sculptured stone slabs that once lined the palace walls are now displayed in museums in Baghdad, Paris, London and Chicago. ISIS currently controls about a third of Iraq and Syria. Iraq's minister of tourism and antiquities said the government was investigating reports that the ancient archaeological site of Hatra in north west Iraq is being demolished by militants from the Islamic State group . Officials in the northern city of Mosul confirmed militants with the terror group have begun destroying the archaeological site of Hatra in northern Iraq. A file photo shows the temple to the Shamash sun god in Hatra . The sculptured stone slabs that once lined the palace walls at Khorsabad are now displayed in museums around the world including these Assyrian winged bulls now housed in the British Museum in London . Other statues of winged bulls from Khorsabad can be found in the Louvre museum in Paris . The Sunni extremist group has been campaigning to purge ancient relics they say promote idolatry that violates their fundamentalist interpretation of Islamic law. On Sunday, officials reported that the jihadists had begun destroying the archaeological site of Hatra in northern Iraq. It comes after fanatics went on a rampage in the Assyrian city of Nimrud in northern Iraq, destroying the 3,000 year-old winged statues placed at the gates of the Palace of Ashurnasirpal. A video released last week also showed them smashing artefacts in the Mosul museum. In January, the group also burned hundreds of books from the Mosul library and Mosul University, including many rare manuscripts. At a press conference earlier yesterday, Mr Shirshab said they have called for an extraordinary session of the UN Security Council to address the crisis in Iraq. 'The world should bear the responsibility and put an end to the atrocities of the militants, otherwise I think the terrorist groups will continue with their violent acts,' he said.","Isis has posted pictures of its 'police' demolishing shrines in Libya .

a5e465fde273fa7836a4acc492d41853963257f5,"An African-American woman who accused Bill Cosby of rape dating back to the 1980s in November has revealed that her race weighed heavily on her decision to come forward with allegations. In an op-ed published on Friday, former model Jewel Allison claimed Cosby forced himself upon her after inviting her to dinner and slipping something into her wine, which made her ill. She wrote that after other accusers came forward, she was not relieved, but instead terrified. Jewel Allison (right, next to Cosby) was a young model when she met Bill Cosby in the late 1980s. She claims that the TV star (left) sexually assaulted her at his home during a dinner . 'As an African-American woman, I felt the stakes were even higher. Historic images of black men being vilified en masse as sexually violent sent chills through my body,' she wrote in the Washington Post. Allison claimed that the night of the dinner party Cosby grabbed her hand and placed it on his genitals. 'That was my sexual assault by this comedian,' she told the New York Daily News. 'He turned me around and said, ""Let's get you home"". At the door, he gave me a very hard embrace and a hard kiss.' She remembers vomiting in the back seat of a cab on the way home. Cosby invited her over again but she declined. Allison in her modeling days (pictured left) and right, more recently. In a recent op-ed with the Washington Post, the former model said that her race weight heavily on her decision to come forward with allegations against Cosby . Speaking about the alleged assault to the Daily News in November, Allison said: 'We may be looking at America's greatest serial rapist that ever got away with this for the longest amount of time. 'He got away with it because he was hiding behind the image of Cliff Huxtable.' But in her op-ed with the Post she said that coming forward with her story would help bring down the entertainer, but she 'feared it would undermine the entire African-American community'. Allison wrote that she didn't come out with her accusations earlier because she didn't want to see 'yet another African-American man vilified in the media'. She said she didn't know if her loyalty should lie with 'women who were sexually victimized or with black America, which has been systematically victimized'. About three dozen women have accused Cosby of sexual misconduct in incidents dating back to the 1960s. The comedian has denied all claims . Like many in America, she watched The Cosby Show, and saw the Dr Huxtable character as a 'much-needed wholesome model of success'. The image of who she saw playing the man swiftly changed on the night she claims he raped her. She concludes her essay by explaining that though Cosby was a source of hope for many, 'fictional icons like him should not wield so much power over our collective spirit'. She adds that though she feared coming forward, 'The only legacy at stake is of one entertainer, not of black manhood, as I once feared'. Attorneys for Cosby asked a federal court judge on Friday to dismiss a defamation suit filed against the comedian in Massachusetts by three women who said he called them liars when they accused him of sexual assault. About three dozen women have accused Cosby, 77, of sexual misconduct in incidents dating back to the 1960s.

fbf6099d3e3a831a0cef1bf15699e91b4d6aeb26,"Former member of 'The Real Housewives of Miami' cast Ana Quincoces was arrested Sunday in Key Largo for driving with a suspended license - an incident she blamed on a cockroach infestation at a friend’s home. But a 911 call from an earlier incident involving Quincoces suggests that unrequited love may have set her on the path to jail. The 50-year-old lawyer and cookbook author from Coral Gables was pulled over in her Subaru SUV by a Monroe County sheriff's deputy at mile marker 99 on US 1 at around 3.40am. Busted: Former member of 'The Real Housewives of Miami' cast Ana Quincoces, 50, (pictured left in her mugshot) was arrested Sunday in Key Largo for driving with a suspended license . TV star: Quincoces (second from left) starred on Season 2 of the Bravo reality TV show in 2012 . The officer wrote in the incident report, cited by Keys Info Net, that he stopped Quincoces because he recognized her from a previous encounter that took place just hours earlier. Police responding to a ‘disturbance call’ on Bahama Avenue confronted Ms Quincoces and informed her that her license had been suspended indefinitely February 9 and 'she was not to drive.' In the early hours of Sunday morning, the same deputy stopped Quincoces outside the Courtyard by Marriot Hotel in Key Largo and demanded to know why she was driving after being explicitly told not to get behind the wheel. The reality TV star was taken to the Plantation Key jail on a misdemeanor charge of driving with a suspended license and released just after 5am on her own recognizance. Quincoces starred on Season 2 of the Bravo reality TV show in 2012 and also made several appearances on the program in 2011 and 2013. Multi-talented: Quincoces, a lawyer by trade, pictured here last October at a charity event in Miami, is also a chef and cookbook author . Roach phobia: Quincoces said the house where she was staying turned out to be infested with cockroaches, which prompted her to get in her car and head home . On Monday, the 50-year-old 'Real Housewives' alum explained to Keysnet.com that she was staying at a house in Key Largo, which had been listed by a realtor friend, but discovered that it was crawling with cockroaches. Desperate to get away from the critters, she got in her car and set out for home in Coral Gables. Quincoces claimed she ‘didn’t realize’ her license was suspended, even though deputies warned her she was not allowed to drive just hours earlier. The lawyer-turned-chef chalked up the entire incident to an ‘administrative glitch’ and accused police of being ‘overzealous.’ But according to the celebrity blog Gossip Extra, it all started hours earlier when Ana Quincoces drove down to Key Largo and barged into her ex-boyfriend’s home searching for his new girlfriend. A 911 call placed by the homeowner allegedly picked up a shouting match between Quincoces, her former lover and his new flame. Bad romance: An earlier 911 call placed by her former boyfriend suggests that Quincoces showed up on his doorstep drunk and demanded to meet his new girlfriend . Quincoces was reportedly heard yelling in the background that she came all this way after a night of drinking and had no intention of going anywhere. The man repeatedly tried to convince Quincoces to leave, at one point telling her: 'I don’t want you here, I’m through with you!' The 911 call concluded with the arrival of deputies.

a5d96f931b40f11af1166dcb4399e7c1fcf7e9ab,"Dzhokhar Tsarnaev's lawyers have been trying to paint him as a gullible teen who was recruited by his extremist brother to bomb the Boston Marathon finish line two years ago. But today, prosecutors presented the jury with a never-before-seen photo that tells quite a different story. Seen in the bedroom of his family home in Cambridge, Massachusetts, Dzhokhar Tsarnaev sits at a computer chair and points to a black flag behind him - not unlike the kind used by extremist groups like al-Qaeda and ISIS. Tsarnaev's former best friend Stephen Silva testified in court on Tuesday that he saw the flag hanging in Dzhokhar's room, the one time he visited the apartment to watch The Walking Dead. Scroll down for video . Decoration: A new picture emerged of Dzhokhar Tsarnaev in court on Tuesday, showing the accused Boston bomber posing underneath a black banner of Islam in the bedroom of his Cambridge family home . Silva was also the friend who lent Tsarnaev the gun used to shoot an MIT police officer in a confrontation a few days after the bombings. While the so-called Black Banner or Black Standard has been co-opted by Islamist extremist groups in recent years, it has much deeper origins in the Muslim world. The prophet Muhammed used a black standard when he fought, which is why it continues to be used as a symbol for modern-day jihadists. According to Boston University master Arabic lecturer Giselle Khoury, the flag reads: 'There is no god but Allah, and Muhammad is Allah's Messenger'. She told the Boston Herald that the statement is called 'the shahada - the testimony' which declares one's belief in the Islamic faith. However, quickly after the picture of the flag was shown in court today, U.S. District Court Judge George A. O’Toole Jr ordered taken out of court since he found it 'illegible'. Assistant U.S. Attorney Aloke Chakravarty said another witness, who did not take the stand today, would be explaining the flag's significance further. Tsarnaev, 21, is charged with killing three people and injuring 264 with a pair of homemade pressure-cooker bombs at the race's crowded finish line on April 15, 2013, and shooting dead a university police officer three days later. Where the Boston Bombing was hatched: The jury deciding the federal death penalty trial were also shown other pictures from the Tsarnaev family home, including the image of the right of Dzhokhar's home computer . Authorities release this picture of the flag - which has become a symbol of Islamic terror groups the world over since the 1990s . Where he slept: Dzhokhar's former best friend Stephan Silva says they were friends for several years, but that he only visited the Tsarnaev house once to watch an episode of The Walking Dead on a computer from the top bunk of Dzhokhar's bunk-bed (above) Strict older brother: Silva told the court on Tuesday that he had never met his elder brother Tamerlan (left) and that Dzhokhar (right) described him as 'very strict, very opinionated' His former best friend Stephen Silva, who federal prosecutors contend loaned . Tsarnaev the gun used in the shooting, testified in court on Tuesday that he had long been close with the defendant but had never met his 26-year-old . brother, Tamerlan, who died following a gunfight with police . four days after the bombing. He said his brother was very strict, very opinionated, and . that since I wasn't a Muslim he might give me a little s*** for . that,' Silva said. Defense lawyers opened the trial at U.S. District Court in . Boston with the blunt admission that Dzhokhar Tsarnaev had . carried out the crimes he is charged with, focusing their hopes . on the jury sentencing him to life in prison rather than the . death penalty he could face if found guilty. They contend Tamerlan was the driving force behind the . attacks and that his younger sibling followed out of . subservience. Convict friends: Friend of Dzhokhar Tsarnaev, Stephen Silva (left), testified at the Boston bombing trial on Tuesday about his 'strict' older brother Tamerlan. He is currently in jail on weapons and drug charges. Tsarnaev and Silva pictured on the right at their high school graduation . Prosecutors called Silva, 21, to the witness stand to . discuss the loan of the rusty Ruger P95 handgun they contend was . used to shoot dead Massachusetts Institute of Technology police . officer Sean Collier on April 18, 2013. Silva has pleaded guilty to federal gun and drug charges, . but was offered leniency in exchange for his testimony. He . testified he had gotten the gun from a friend, intending to use . it to protect his drug business, and also used it in a robbery. Tsarnaev asked to borrow it, saying he too was interested in . committing a robbery, Silva testified. On loan: The gun was part of evidence shown in court on Tuesday. Friend of Dzhokhar Tsarnaev, Stephen Silva,  allegedly gave him the weapon which was used to kill MIT officer Sean Collier . Ruined: This smashed-up iPhone was found at the scene of a shootout between the Tsarnaev brothers and police in the suburb of Watertown on April 18 - a few days after the bombings . In the most aggressive cross-examination by the defense in . eight days of testimony, Silva acknowledged having posted on . Facebook and having told the FBI that he believed the bombing must have been Tamerlan's idea. 'At the time that's what I felt, yes,' Silva said in . response to questioning by defense attorney Miriam Conrad. He also acknowledged having told prosecutors in August he . used 'peer pressure' to persuade Dzhokhar to smoke marijuana, . which Silva sold. 'That's what I said but I stated it wrong,' Silva said on . Tuesday. Emerging: Boston Marathon bomber Dzhokhar Tsarnaev, bloody and disheveled with the red dot of a sniper's rifle laser sight on his head, emerges from a boat at the time of his capture by law enforcement authorities in Watertown, Massachusetts on April 19, 2013 . Hide-out: In this courtroom sketch, the boat in which Dzhokhar Tsarnaev was captured was depicted on a trailer for observation during Tsarnaev's federal death penalty trial on Monday . In court: In this courtroom sketch, Tsarnaev, center seated, is depicted between defense attorneys while the boat in which he was captured in sits on a trailer for observation during his federal death penalty trial on Monday . Message: Inside the boat where Dzhokhar Tsarnaev hid for hours before he was captured by police, he carved on wood panels the phrase: 'Stop killing our innocent people and we will stop' Inscription: Another picture of the wood panels taken from inside Henneberry's boat . Silva also testified that Dzhokhar Tsarnaev had once called . him a 'kafir,' an Arabic word meaning non-believer or infidel, . in response to Silva calling the defendant a 'Russian refugee'. Tsarnaev is an ethnic Chechen whose family moved to the . U.S. a decade before the attack. Other than the 'kafir' incident, Silva said Tsarnaev had . rarely talked about religion. Also on Tuesday, the owner of the boat where Tsarnaev hid . after a gunfight with police recalled stepping into his backyard . after a day-long lock down was lifted and finding a person in his . watercraft. David Henneberry described waking up the morning after a . gunfight between the Tsarnaev brothers and police rocked his . suburban neighborhood and noticing something wrong about the . winter covering of his boat, but presuming it had been blown . around by the wind. He put off checking it until after authorities had lifted a . shelter-in-place order on Boston-area residents four days after . the bombing, WBZ reported. 'I went to check on the boat and basically see why the strap . was loose and I noticed a lot of blood,' Henneberry said. 'I . just kept fixating on this blood and then, I just, my eyes . looked at the other side of the boat and that's when I saw a . body in the boat ... I got off the ladder pretty quick and went . in the house.' When prosecutors wrap up their case it will be the defense's . turn to call witnesses, who could include Tsarnaev. After that, . the jury will consider Tsarnaev's guilt. If he is found guilty, . a second phase will play out that will focus on sentencing. The bombing killed restaurant manager Krystle Campbell, 29, . graduate student Lingzi Lu, 23, and 8-year-old Martin Richard. Henneberry said after he called 911, bringing dozens of . heavily armed police who fired scores of rounds into the boat . where Tsarnaev was discovered. The jury also saw two wooden slats from the boat into which . a message had been carved which read: 'Stop killing our innocent . people and we will stop.' On cross-examination, Mr Henneberry was asked by the defense if the blood and bullet holes in his boat were there before April 19. He confirmed that they were not. Final words: Inside the boat, Tsarnaev wrote a series of notes, which the jury saw on Monday. This note, punctured with bullets, explains how he is jealous of his brother Tamerlan because he had died and gone to paradise . The notes also denounced the U.S. for its wars in Muslim countries. Last week, the jury heard how all the bullets that made holes in the side of the boat were shot from outside the vessel as he hid inside . Investigators on a boat in Watertown, Massachusetts the day after Dzhokhar Tsarnaev was found hiding inside in April 2013.

90b6909ed63da4e60fc320d54236128868f31ff5,"Last month, TransAsia Airways flight GE-235  crashed shortly after take-off, killing 31 people. The crash site, in Taipei, represents tragedy for those who lost family members and friends in the disaster, yet to a handful of tourists, it made the perfect background for a holiday snap. The photo, published by Hong Kong's Apple Daily, shows three women posing  in front of the  Keeling River, as boats search for crash victims behind them. Tourists pose at the AirAsia crash site, in Taipei, while rescue boats search for bodies in the background . Visiting scenes of death and disaster might seem inappropriate to the average holidaymaker, but dark tourism appears to be on the rise. Philip Stone is Executive Director: Institute for Dark Tourism Research (iDTR), School of Sport, Tourism and The Outdoors, University of Central Lancashire (UCLan), Preston, UK. In his paper, Dark Tourism Scholarship: A Critical Review, he explains: 'The act of travel to sites of death, disaster or the seemingly macabre – or what has commonly been referred to as dark tourism – is an increasingly pervasive feature within the contemporary visitor economy. People pose for selfies  at the site of the Sydney siege, in which a lone gunman held hostage ten customers and eight employees of a Lindt chocolate café located at Martin Place in Sydney, Australia. Three were killed . Social media users shared their pictures, often featuring television camera crews in the background . 'Indeed, the commodification of death for popular touristic consumption, whether in the guise of memorials and museums, visitor attractions, special events and exhibitions, or specific tours, has become a focus for mainstream tourism providers.' Introduced in 1996 the term ‘dark tourism' was brought to the mainstream in 2000, in Lennon and Foley's book Dark Tourism: The Attraction of Death and Disaster. Professor Mark Griffiths of Nottingham Trent University, who has written a blog post on death fascination says there are a number of reasons for our interest in the macabre. 'There's a huge market for witnessing the extremities of human behaviour. By looking at something so extreme it makes us feel better about ourselves,' he told MailOnline Travel. Almost four years the Fukushima crisis, tourists are queuing up to see its abandoned neighborhoods . Countless travel companies offer tours of the Chernobyl Zone in Ukraine. Abandoned hospital beds, pictured . 'Entrepreneurs can exploit that. At the Costa Concordia site people were charging ten euros for tourists wanting to see it.' 'There is also now much more of a desire for unique experiences - we want to do something something that not a lot of other people have done, so we can tell our friends about it. 'Also, people want to be involved in pivotal events in history,' says Professor Griffiths, which explains the photographs taken at plane crash sites. 'But this is nothing new,' he adds. 'People have always flocked towards death -  think of public beheadings.' A man takes pictures  outside the headquarters of French satirical magazine, Charlie Hebdo, in Paris . An exhibit at the 'Top Secret Spy Museum' in Oberhausen, 300 miles from the site of the original lair, pictured here, is scheduled to open later this year . In South London, Bethlem mental asylum - famously nicknamed Bedlam - recently opened its new £4milllion museum displaying the shackles, ankle tags, padded clothing and disturbing paintings visitors a real insight into the minds of its patients. While tragic global events appear to trigger an alarming trend for voyeuristic travel. After the dust settled outside the office of Charlie Hebdo, the Parisian satirical magazine where extremists opened fire, killing 12 people, tourists gathered. In Australia, social media fans were quick to share their selfies from the site of the Sydney siege, last December, in which a lone gunman held hostage ten customers and eight employees of a Lindt chocolate café located at Martin Place in Sydney, Australia. Three civilians were killed. And New York's Ground Zero, site of the destruction of the World Trade Centre on September 11, 2001, became - and still is - one of the largest tourist attractions in New York. Following in the footsteps of the countless tours of the Chernobyl Zone offered in Ukraine, recent reports revealed that the site of Japan's nuclear disaster Fukushima is now a tourism hot spot. 1.

London's Bethlem hospital's new museum displays shackles, padded clothing and paintings of its patients . The museum celebrates the lives  of those living with mental ill-health and explores the long history of Bethlem . Almost four years after the tsunami caused by a magnitude 9.0 earthquake led to the crisis which caused entire towns to evacuate, tourists are queuing up to see abandoned neighborhoods and crumbling buildings. 'We want to encourage local people for the revitalisation of Fukushima,' tour guide Yusuke Kato told CNN. Genocide, suicide and death are all driving tourism. In January, a German museum announced that it is rebuilding the bunker where Hitler committed suicide in 1945 as a tourist attraction. Replicating five rooms from the Führerbunker in which the Nazi leader lived during the final months of the Second World War, the exhibit at the 'Top Secret Spy Museum' in Oberhausen, 300 miles from the site of the original lair, is scheduled to open later this year. 'We want this to be an educational experience so that families or groups of school kids can see how it really was; to experience the tiny rooms and the dampness of the bunker. We want to recreate it to show people,' museum director Ingo Mersmann told thelocal.de website.
